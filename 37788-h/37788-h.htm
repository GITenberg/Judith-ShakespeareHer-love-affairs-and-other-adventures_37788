<h2>JUDITH SHAKESPEARE.</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>AN ASSIGNATION.</h3>

<p>It was a fair, clear, and shining morning, in the sweet
May-time of the year, when a young English damsel went
forth from the town of Stratford-upon-Avon to walk in the
fields. As she passed along by the Guild Chapel and the
Grammar School, this one and the other that met her gave
her a kindly greeting; for nearly every one knew her, and
she was a favorite; and she returned those salutations with
a frankness which betokened rather the self-possession of
a young woman than the timidity of a girl. Indeed, she
was no longer in the first sensitive dawn of maidenhood&mdash;having,
in fact, but recently passed her five-and-twentieth
birthday&mdash;but nevertheless there was the radiance of youth
in the rose-leaf tint of her cheeks, and in the bright cheerfulness
of her eyes. Those eyes were large, clear, and
gray, with dark pupils and dark lashes; and these are a
dangerous kind; for they can look demure, and artless,
and innocent, when there is nothing in the mind of the
owner of them but a secret mirth; and also&mdash;and alas!&mdash;they
can effect another kind of concealment, and when the
heart within is inclined to soft pity and yielding, they can
refuse to confess to any such surrender, and can maintain,
at the bidding of a wilful coquetry, an outward and obstinate
coldness and indifference. For the rest, her hair, which
was somewhat short and curly, was of a light and glossy
brown, with a touch of sunshine in it; she had a good figure,
for she came of a quite notably handsome family; she
walked with a light step and a gracious carriage; and
there were certain touches of style and color about her
costume which showed that she did not in the least undervalue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>her appearance. And so it was "Good-morrow to
you, sweet Mistress Judith," from this one and the other;
and "Good-morrow, friend So-and-so," she would answer;
and always she had the brightest of smiles for them as they
passed.</p>

<p>Well, she went along by the church, and over the foot-bridge
spanning the Avon, and so on into the meadows lying
adjacent to the stream. To all appearance she was
bent on nothing but deliberate idleness, for she strayed
this way and that, stooping to pick up a few wild flowers,
and humming to herself as she went. On this fresh and
clear morning the air seemed to be filled with sweet perfumes
after the close atmosphere of the town; and if it was merely
to gather daisies, and cuckoo-flowers, and buttercups,
that she had come, she was obviously in no hurry about it.
The sun was warm on the rich green grass; the swallows
were dipping and flashing over the river; great humble-bees
went booming by; and far away somewhere in the
silver-clear sky a lark was singing. And she also was
singing, as she strayed along by the side of the stream,
picking here and there a speedwell, and here and there a
bit of self-heal or white dead-nettle; if, indeed that could
be called singing that was but a careless and unconscious
recalling of snatches of old songs and madrigals. At one
moment it was:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why, say you so? Oh no, no, no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young maids must never a-wooing go.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And again it was:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, blow thy horn, hunter!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, blow thy horn, hunter!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, blow thy horn, jolly hunter!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And again it was:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For a morn in spring is the sweetest thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cometh in all the year!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And in truth she could not have lit upon a sweeter morning
than this was; just as a chance passer-by might have
said to himself that he had never seen a pleasanter sight
than this young English maiden presented as she went
idly along the river-side, gathering wild flowers the while.</p>

<p>But in course of time, when she came to a part of the
Avon from which the bank ascended sharp and steep, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>when she began to make her way along a narrow and
winding foot-path that ascended through the wilderness of
trees and bushes hanging on this steep bank, she became
more circumspect. There was no more humming of
songs; the gathering of flowers was abandoned, though
here she might have added a wild hyacinth or two to her
nosegay; she advanced cautiously, and yet with an affectation
of carelessness; and she was examining, while pretending
not to examine, the various avenues and open
spaces in the dense mass of foliage before her. Apparently,
however, this world of sunlight and green leaves and
cool shadow was quite untenanted; there was no sound
but that of the blackbird and the thrush; she wandered
on without meeting any one. And then, as she had now
arrived at a little dell or chasm in the wood, she left the
foot-path, climbed up the bank, gained the summit, and
finally, passing from among the bushes, she found herself
in the open, at the corner of a field of young corn.</p>

<p>Now if any one had noticed the quick and searching
look that she flashed all around on the moment of her
emerging from the brush-wood&mdash;the swiftness of lightning
was in that rapid scrutiny&mdash;he might have had some suspicion
as to the errand that had brought her hither; but
in an instant her eyes had recovered their ordinary look of
calm and indifferent observation. She turned to regard
the wide landscape spread out below her; and the stranger,
if he had missed that quick and eager glance, would have
naturally supposed that she had climbed up through the
wood to this open space merely to have a better view.
And indeed this stretch of English-looking country was
well worth the trouble, especially at this particular time of
the year, when it was clothed in the fresh and tender
colors of the spring-time; and it was with much seeming
content that this young English maiden stood there and
looked abroad over the prospect&mdash;at the placid river winding
through the lush meadows; at the wooden spire of the
church rising above the young foliage of the elms; at here
and there in the town a red-tiled house visible among the
thatched roofs and gray walls and orchards&mdash;these being
all pale and ethereal and dream-like in the still sunshine
of this quiet morning. It was a peaceful English-looking
picture that ought to have interested her, however familiar
it may have been; and perhaps it was only to look at it
once more that she had made her way up hither; and also
to breathe the cool sweet air of the open, and to listen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>the singing of the birds, that seemed to fill the white wide
spaces of the sky as far as ever she could hear.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware that some one was behind
her and near her, and instantly turning, she found before
her an elderly man with a voluminous gray beard, who appeared
to affect some kind of concealment by the way he
wore his hat and his long cloak.</p>

<p>"God save you, sweet lady!" he had said, almost before
she turned.</p>

<p>But if this stranger imagined that by his unlooked-for
approach and sudden address he was likely to startle the
young damsel out of her self-possession, he knew very
little with whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>"Good-morrow to you, good Master Wizard," said she,
with perfect calmness, and she regarded him from head to
foot with nothing beyond a mild curiosity. Indeed, it was
rather he who was embarrassed. He looked at her with a
kind of wonder&mdash;and admiration also; and if she had been
sufficiently heedful and watchful she might have observed
that his eyes, which were singularly dark, had a good deal
of animation in them for one of his years. It was only
after a second or so of this bewildered and admiring contemplation
of her that he managed to say, in a grave and
formal voice, something in praise of her courage in thus
keeping the appointment he had sought.</p>

<p>"Nay, good sir," said she, with much complacency,
"trouble not yourself about me. There is no harm in
going out to gather a few flowers in the field, surely. If
there be any danger, it is rather you that have to fear it,
for there is the pillory for them that go about the country
divining for gold and silver."</p>

<p>"It is for no such vain and idle purposes that I use my
art," said he; and he regarded her with such an intensity
of interest that sometimes he stumbled forgetfully in his
speech, as if he were repeating a lesson but ill prepared,
"It is for the revelation of the future to them that are
born under fortunate planets. And you are one of these,
sweet lady, or I would not have summoned you to a meeting
that might have seemed perilous to one of less courage
and good heart. If it please you to listen, I can forecast
that that will befall you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, good sir," said she, with a smile, "I have heard
it frequently, though perhaps never from one so skilled.
'Tis but a question between dark and fair, with plenty of
money and lands thrown in. For that matter, I might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>set up in the trade myself. But if you could tell me,
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I were to tell you&mdash;if by my art I could show you,"
said he, with a solemnity that was at least meant to be impressive
(though this young maid, with her lips inclining
to a smile, and her inscrutable eyes, did not seem much
awe-stricken)&mdash;"if I could convince you, sweet lady, that
you shall marry neither dark nor fair among any of those
that would now fain win you&mdash;and rumor says there be
several of those&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"Rumor?" she repeated, with the color swiftly mantling
in her face. But she was startled, and she said,
quickly, "What do you say, good wizard? Not any one
that I know? What surety have you of that? Is it true?
Can you show it to me? Can you assure me of it? Is
your skill so great that you can prove to me that your
prophecy is aught but idle guessing? No one that I have
seen as yet, say you? Why," she added half to herself,
"but that were good news for my gossip Prue."</p>

<p>"My daughter," said this elderly person, in slow and
measured tones, "it is not to all that the stars have been
so propitious at their birth."</p>

<p>"Good sir," said she, with some eagerness, "I beseech
you to forgive me if I attend you not; but&mdash;but this is the
truth, now, as to how I came in answer to your message
to me. I will speak plain. Perchance rumor hath not
quite belied herself. There may be one or two who think
too well of me, and would have me choose him or him to
be my lover; and&mdash;and&mdash;do you see now?&mdash;if there were
one of those that I would fain have turn aside from idle
thoughts of me and show more favor to my dear cousin
and gossip Prudence Shawe&mdash;nay, but to tell the truth,
good wizard, I came here to seek of your skill whether it
could afford some charm and magic that would direct his
heart to her. I have heard of such things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And here she stopped abruptly, in some confusion, for
she had in her eagerness admitted a half-belief in the possible
power of his witchcraft which she had been careful
to conceal before. She had professed incredulity by her
very manner; she had almost laughed at his pretensions;
she had intimated that she had come hither only out of curiosity;
but now she had blundered into the confession
that she had cherished some vague hope of obtaining a
love-philtre, or some such thing, to transfer away from
herself to her friend the affections of one of those suitors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>whose existence seemed to be so well known to the wizard.
However, he soon relieved her from her embarrassment by
assuring her that this that she demanded was far away beyond
the scope of his art, which was strictly limited to the
discovery and revelation of such secrets as still lay within
the future.</p>

<p>"And if so, good sir," said she, after a moment's reflection,
"that were enough, or nearly enough, so that you
can convince us of it."</p>

<p>"To yourself alone, gracious lady," said he, "can I reveal
that which will happen to you. Nay, more, so fortunate
is the conjunction of the planets that reigned at
your birth&mdash;the <i>ultimum supplicium auri</i> might almost have
been declared to you&mdash;that I can summon from the ends of
the earth, be he where he may, the man that you shall
hereafter marry, or soon or late I know not; if you will,
you can behold him at such and such a time, at such and
such a place, as the stars shall appoint."</p>

<p>She looked puzzled, half incredulous and perplexed, inclined
to smile, blushing somewhat, and all uncertain.</p>

<p>"It is a temptation&mdash;I were no woman else," said she,
with a laugh. "Nay, but if I can see him, why may not
others? And if I can show them him who is to be my
worshipful lord and master, why, then, my gossip Prue
may have the better chance of reaching the goal where I
doubt not her heart is fixed. Come, then, to prove your
skill, good sir. Where shall I see him, and when? Must
I use charms? Will he speak, think you, or pass as a
ghost? But if he be not a proper man, good wizard, by
my life I will have none of him, nor of your magic either."</p>

<p>She was laughing now, and rather counterfeiting a kind
of scorn; but she was curious; and she watched him with
a lively interest as he took forth from a small leather bag
a little folded piece of paper, which he carefully opened.</p>

<p>"I cannot answer all your questions, my daughter," said
he; "I can but proceed according to my art. Whether
the person you will see may be visible to others I know
not, nor can I tell you aught of his name or condition.
Pray Heaven he be worthy of such beauty and gentleness;
for I have heard of you, gracious lady, but rumor had but
poor words to describe such a rarity and a prize."</p>

<p>"Nay," said she, in tones of reproof (but the color had
mounted to a face that certainly showed no sign of displeasure),
"you speak like one of the courtiers now."</p>

<p>"This charm," said he, dropping his eyes, and returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>to his grave and formal tones, "is worth naught without a
sprig of rosemary; that must you get, and you must place
it within the paper in a threefold manner&mdash;thus; and then,
when Sol and Luna are both in the descendant&mdash;but I forget
me, the terms of my art are unknown to you; I must
speak in the vulgar tongue; and meanwhile you shall see
the charm, that there is nothing wicked or dangerous in it,
but only the wherewithal to bring about a true lovers'
meeting."</p>

<p>He handed her the open piece of paper; but she, having
glanced at the writing, gave it him back again.</p>

<p>"I pray you read it to me," she said.</p>

<p>He regarded her for a second with some slight surprise;
but he took the paper, and read aloud, slowly, the lines
written thereon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dare you haunt our hallowed green?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None but fairies here are seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Down and sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wake and weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pinch him black, and pinch him blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seeks to steal a lover true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you come to hear us sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to tread our fairy ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pinch him black, and pinch him blue&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, thus our nails shall handle you!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Why, 'tis like what my father wrote about Herne the
Hunter," said she, with a touch of indifference; perhaps
she had expected to hear something more weird and unholy.</p>

<p>"Please you, forget not the rosemary; nothing will
come of it else," he continued. "Then this you must
take in your hand secretly, and when no one has knowledge
of your outgoing; and when Luna&mdash;nay, but I mean
when the moon has risen to-night so that, standing in the
church-yard, you shall see it over the roof of the church,
then must you go to the yew-tree that is in the middle of
the church-yard, and there you shall scrape away a little
of the earth from near the foot of the tree, and bury this
paper, and put the earth firmly down on it again, saying
thrice, <i>Hieronymo! Hieronymo! Hieronymo!</i> You follow
me, sweet lady?"</p>

<p>"'Tis simple enough," said she, "but that on these fine
evenings the people are everywhere about; and if one
were to be seen conjuring in the church-yard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must watch your opportunity, my daughter," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>he, speaking with an increased assumption of authority.
"One minute will serve you; and this is all that needs be
done."</p>

<p>"Truly? Is this all?" said she, and she laughed
lightly. "Then will my gallant, my pride o' the world,
my lord and master, forthwith spring out of the solid
ground? God mend me, but that were a fearful meeting&mdash;in
a church-yard! Gentle wizard, I pray you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so," he answered, interrupting her. "The charm
will work there; you must let it rest; the night dews
shall nourish it; the slow hours shall pass over it; and the
spirits that haunt these precincts must know of it, that
they may prepare the meeting. To-night, then, sweet lady,
you shall place this charm in the church-yard at the foot
of the yew-tree, and to-morrow at twelve of the clock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By your leave, not to-morrow," said she, peremptorily.
"Not to-morrow, good wizard; for my father comes home
to-morrow; and, by my life, I would not miss the going
forth to meet him for all the lovers between here and London
town!"</p>

<p>"Your father comes home to-morrow, Mistress Judith?"
said he, in somewhat startled accents.</p>

<p>"In truth he does; and Master Tyler also, and Julius
Shawe&mdash;there will be a goodly company, I warrant you,
come riding to-morrow through Shipston and Tredington
and Alderminster; and by your leave, reverend sir, the
magic must wait."</p>

<p>"That were easily done," he answered, after a moment's
thought, "by the alteration of a sign, if the day following
might find you at liberty. Will it so, gracious lady?"</p>

<p>"The day after! At what time of the day?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The alteration of the sign will make it but an hour
earlier, if I mistake not; that is to say, at eleven of the
forenoon you must be at the appointed place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where, good wizard!" said she&mdash;"where am I to see
the wraith, the ghost, the phantom husband that is to own
me?"</p>

<p>"That know I not myself as yet; but my aids and familiars
will try to discover it for me," he answered, taking a small
sun-dial out of his pocket and adjusting it as he spoke.</p>

<p>"And with haste, so please you, good sir," said she, "for
I would not that any chance comer had a tale of this meeting
to carry back to the gossips."</p>

<p>He stooped down and placed the sun-dial carefully on the
ground, at a spot where the young corn was but scant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>enough on the dry red soil, and then with his forefinger he
traced two or three lines and a <span class="err" title="original: semicicle">semicircle</span> on the crumbling
earth.</p>

<p>"South by west," said he, and he muttered some words
to himself. Then he looked up. "Know you the road to
Bidford, sweet lady?"</p>

<p>"As well as I know my own ten fingers," she answered.</p>

<p>"For myself, I know it not, but if my art is not misleading
there should be, about a mile or more along that road,
another road at right angles with it, bearing to the right,
and there at the junction should stand a cross of stone. Is
it so?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the lane that leads to Shottery; well I know it,"
she said.</p>

<p>"So it has been appointed, then," said he, "if the stars
continue their protection over you. The day after to-morrow,
at eleven of the forenoon, if you be within stone's-throw
of the cross at the junction of the roads, there shall
you see, or my art is strangely mistaken, the man or gentleman&mdash;nay,
I know not whether he be parson or layman,
soldier or merchant, knight of the shire or plain goodman
Dick&mdash;I say there shall you see him that is to win you and
wear you; but at what time you shall become his wife, and
where, and in what circumstances, I cannot reveal to you.
I have done my last endeavor."</p>

<p>"Nay do not hold me ungrateful," she said, though there
was a smile on her lips, "but surely, good sir, what your
skill has done, that it can also undo. If it have power to
raise a ghost, surely it has power to lay him. And truly,
if he be a ghost, I will not have him. And if he be a man,
and have a red beard, I will not have him. And if he be a
slape-face, I will have none of him. And if he have thin
legs, he may walk his ways for me. Good wizard, if I like
him not, you must undo the charm."</p>

<p>"My daughter, you have a light heart," said he, gravely.
"May the favoring planets grant it lead you not into mischief;
there be unseen powers that are revengeful. And
now I must take my leave, gracious lady. I have given
you the result of much study and labor, of much solitary
communion with the heavenly bodies; take it, and use it
with heed, and so fare you well."</p>

<p>He was going, but she detained him.</p>

<p>"Good sir, I am your debtor," said she, with the red blood
mantling in her forehead, for all through this interview she
had clearly recognized that she was not dealing with any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>ordinary mendicant fortune-teller. "So much labor and
skill I cannot accept from you without becoming a beggar.
I pray you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put up his hand.</p>

<p>"Not so," said he, with a certain grave dignity. "To
have set eyes on the fairest maid in Warwickshire&mdash;as I
have heard you named&mdash;were surely sufficient recompense
for any trouble; and to have had speech of you, sweet lady,
is what many a one would venture much for. But I would
humbly kiss your hand; and so again fare you well."</p>

<p>"God shield you, most courteous wizard, and good-day,"
said she, as he left; and for a second she stood looking
after him in a kind of wonder, for this extraordinary courtesy
and dignity of manner were certainly not what she
had expected to find in a vagabond purveyor of magic.
But now he was gone, and she held the charm in her hand,
and so without further ado she set out for home again, getting
down through the brushwood to the winding path.</p>

<p>She walked quickly, for she had heard that Master Bushell's
daughter, who was to be married that day, meant to
beg a general holiday for the school-boys; and she knew
that if this were granted these sharp-eyed young imps
would soon be here, there, and everywhere, and certain to
spy out the wizard if he were in the neighborhood. But
when she had got clear of this hanging copse, that is known
as the Wier Brake, and had reached the open meadows, so
that from any part around she could be seen to be alone,
she had nothing further to fear, and she returned to her
leisurely straying in quest of flowers. The sun was hotter
on the grass now; but the swallows were busy as ever over
the stream; and the great bees hummed aloud as they went
past; and here and there a white butterfly fluttered from
petal to petal; and, far away, she could hear the sound of
children's voices in the stillness. She was in a gay mood.
The interview she had just had with one in league with the
occult powers of magic and witchery did not seem in the
least to have overawed her. Perhaps, indeed, she had not
yet made up her mind to try the potent charm that she had
obtained; at all events the question did not weigh heavily
on her. For now it was,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, mistress mine, where are you roaming?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and again it was,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For a morn in spring is the sweetest thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cometh in all the year!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>and always another touch of color added to the daintily
arranged nosegay in her hand. And then, of a sudden, as
she chanced to look ahead, she observed a number of the
school-boys come swarming down to the foot-bridge; and
she knew right well that one of them&mdash;to wit, young Willie
Hart&mdash;would think a holiday quite thrown away and wasted
if he did not manage to seek out and secure the company
of his pretty cousin Judith.</p>

<p>"Ah! there, now," she was saying to herself, as she
watched the school-boys come over the bridge one by one
and two by two, "there, now, is my sweetheart of sweethearts;
there is my prince of lovers! If ever I have lover
as faithful and kind as he, it will go well. 'Nay, Susan,'
says he, 'I love you not; you kiss me hard, and speak to
me as if I were still a child; I love Judith better.' And
how cruel of my father to put him in the play, and to slay
him so soon; but perchance he will call him to life again&mdash;nay,
it is a favorite way with him to do that; and pray
Heaven he bring home with him to-morrow the rest of the
story, that Prue may read it to me. And so are you there,
among the unruly imps, you young Prince Mamillius?
Have you caught sight of me yet, sweetheart blue-eyes?
Why, come, then; you will outstrip them all, I know, when
you get sight of Cousin Judith; for as far off as yon are,
you will reach me first, that I am sure of; and then, by my
life, sweetheart Willie, you shall have a kiss as soft as a
dove's breast!"</p>

<p>And so she went on to meet them, arranging the colors
of her straggling blossoms the while, with now and again
a snatch of careless song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, blow thy horn, hunter!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, blow thy horn, hunter!<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>SIGNIOR CRAB-APPLE.</h3>

<p>There was much ado in the house all that day, in view
of the home-coming on the morrow, and it was not till
pretty late in the evening that Judith was free to steal out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>for a gossip with her friend and chief companion, Prudence
Shawe. She had not far to go&mdash;but a couple of doors off, in
fact; and her coming was observed by Prudence herself,
who happened to be sitting at the casemented window for
the better prosecution of her needle-work, there being still
a clear glow of twilight in the sky. A minute or so thereafter
the two friends were in Prudence's own chamber,
which was on the first floor, and looking out to the back over
barns and orchards; and they had gone to the window, to the
bench there, to have their secrets together. This Prudence
Shawe was some two years Judith's junior&mdash;though she
really played the part of elder sister to her; she was of a
pale complexion, with light straw-colored hair; not very
pretty, perhaps, but she had a restful kind of face that invited
friendliness and sympathy, of which she had a large
abundance to give in return. Her custom was of a Puritanical
plainness and primness, both in the fashion of it
and in its severe avoidance of color; and that was not the
only point on which she formed a marked contrast to this
dear cousin and wilful gossip of hers, who had a way of
pleasing herself (more especially if she thought she might
thereby catch her father's eye) in apparel as in most other
things. And on this occasion&mdash;at the outset at all events&mdash;Judith
would not have a word said about the assignation
of the morning. The wizard was dismissed from her mind
altogether. It was about the home-coming of the next day
that she was all eagerness and excitement; and her chief
prayer and entreaty was that her friend Prudence should
go with her to welcome the travellers home.</p>

<p>"Nay, but you must and shall, dear Prue; sweet mouse, I
beg it of you!" she was urging. "Every one at New Place
is so busy that they have fixed upon Signior Crab-apple to
ride with me; and you know I cannot suffer him; and I
shall not have a word of my father all the way back, not a
word; there will be nothing but a discourse about fools,
and idle jests, and wiseman Matthew the hero of the
day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Judith, I cannot understand how you dislike
the old man so," her companion said, in that smooth voice
of hers. "I see no garden that is better tended than
yours."</p>

<p>"I would I could let slip the mastiff at his unmannerly
throat!" was the quick reply&mdash;and indeed for a second
she looked as if she would fain have seen that wish fulfilled.
"The vanity of him!&mdash;the puffed-up pride of him.&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>thinks there be none in Warwickshire but himself
wise enough to talk to my father; and the way he dogs
his steps if he be walking in the garden&mdash;no one else may
have a word with him!&mdash;sure my father is sufficiently
driven forth by the preachers and the psalm-singing within-doors
that out-of-doors, in his own garden, he might
have some freedom of speech with his own daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judith, Judith," her friend said, and she put her hand
on her arm, "you have such wilful thoughts, and wild
words too. I am sure your father is free of speech with
every one&mdash;gentle and simple, old and young, it matters
not who it is that approaches him."</p>

<p>"This Signior Crab-apple truly!" the other exclaimed,
in the impetuosity of her scorn. "If his heart be as big
as a crab-apple, I greatly doubt; but that it is of like
quality I'll be sworn. And the bitterness of his railing
tongue! All women are fools&mdash;vools he calls them, rather&mdash;first
and foremost; and most men are fools; but of all
fools there be none like the fools of Warwickshire&mdash;that
is because my worshipful goodman gardener comes all the
way from Bewdley. 'Tis meat and drink to him, he says,
to discover a fool, though how he should have any difficulty
in the discovering, seeing that we are all of us
fools, passes my understanding. Nay, but I know what
set him after that quarry; 'twas one day in the garden, and
my father was just come home from London, and he was
talking to my uncle Gilbert, and was laughing at what his
friend Benjamin Jonson had said, or had written, I know
not which. 'Of all beasts in the world,' says he, 'I love
most the serious ass.' Then up steps goodman Matthew.
'There be plenty of 'em about 'ere, zur,' says he, with a
grin on his face like that on a cat when a dog has her by
the tail. And my father, who will talk to any one, as you
say truly, and about anything, and always with the same
attention, must needs begin to challenge goodman Crab-apple
to declare the greatest fools that ever he had met
with; and from that day to this the ancient sour-face hath
been on the watch&mdash;and it suits well with his opinion of
other people and his opinion of himself as the only wise man
in the world&mdash;I say ever since he hath been on the watch for
fools; and the greater the fool the greater his wisdom, I
reckon, that can find him out. A purveyor of fools!&mdash;a
goodly trade! I doubt not but that it likes him better than
the tending of apricots when he has the free range of the
ale-houses to work on. He will bring a couple of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>into the garden when my father is in the summer-house.
''Ere, zur, please you come out and look 'ere, zur; 'ere
be a brace of rare vools.' And the poor clowns are
proud of it; they stand and look at each other and laugh.
'We be, zur&mdash;we be.' And then my father will say no,
and will talk with them, and cheer them with assurance
of their wisdom; then must they have spiced bread and
ale ere they depart; and this is a triumph for Master Matthew&mdash;the
withered, shrivelled, dried-up, cankered nutshell
that he is!"</p>

<p>"Dear Judith, pray have patience&mdash;indeed you are
merely jealous."</p>

<p>"Jealous!" she exclaimed, as if her scorn of this ill-conditioned
old man put that well out of the question.</p>

<p>"You think he has too much of your father's company,
and you like it not; but consider of it, Judith, he being in
the garden, and your father in the summer-house, and
when your father is tired for the moment of his occupation,
whatever that may be, then can he step out and
speak to this goodman Matthew, that amuses him with
his biting tongue, and with the self-sufficiency of his wisdom&mdash;nay,
I suspect your father holds him to be a greater
fool than any that he makes sport of, and that he loves to
lead him on."</p>

<p>"And why should my father have to be in the summer-house
but that in-doors the wool-spinning is hardly more
constant than the lecturing and the singing of psalms and
hymns?"</p>

<p>"Judith! Judith!" said her gentle friend, with real
trouble on her face, "you grieve me when you talk like
that&mdash;indeed you do, sweetheart! There is not a morning
nor a night passes that I do not pray the Lord that
your heart may be softened and led to our ways&mdash;nay, far
from that, but to the Lord's own ways&mdash;and the answer
will come; I have faith; I know it; and God send it speedily,
for you are like an own sister to me, and my heart yearns
over you!"</p>

<p>The other sat silent for a second. She could not fail to
be touched by the obvious sincerity, the longing kindness
of her friend, but she would not confess as much in words.</p>

<p>"As yet, sweet Prue," said she, lightly, "I suppose I am
of the unregenerate, and if it is wicked to cherish evil
thoughts of your neighbor, then am I not of the elect, for
I heartily wish that Tom Quiney and some of the youths
would give Matthew gardener a sound ducking in a horse-pond,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>to tame his arrogance withal. But no matter. What
say you, dear Prue? Will you go with me to-morrow, so
that we may have the lad Tookey in charge of us, and
Signior Crab-apple be left to his weeding and grafting
and railing at human kind? Do, sweet mouse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The maids are busy now, Judith," said she, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"But a single day, dear mouse!" she urged. "And if
we go early we may get as far as Shipston, and await them
there. Have you no desire to meet your brother, Prudence&mdash;to
be the first of all to welcome him home? Nay,
that is because you can have him in your company as often
as you wish; there is no goodman-wiseman-fool to
come between you."</p>

<p>"Dear heart," said Prudence Shawe, with a smile, "I
know not what is the witchery of you, but there is none
I wot of that can say you nay."</p>

<p>"You will, then?" said the other, joyfully. "Ah, look,
now, the long ride home we shall have with my father,
and all the news I shall have to tell him! And all good
news, Prue; scarcely a whit or bit that is not good news:
the roan that he bought at Evesham is well of her lameness&mdash;good;
and the King's mulberry is thriving bravely
(I wonder that wiseman Matthew has not done it a mischief
in the night-time, for the King, being above him in station,
must needs have nothing from him but sour and envious
words); and then the twenty acres that my father so set
his heart upon he is to have&mdash;I hear that the Combes have
said as much&mdash;and my father will be right well pleased;
and the vicar is talking no longer of building the new
piggery over against the garden&mdash;at least for the present
there is nothing to be done: all good news; but there is
better still, as you know; for what will he say when he
discovers that I have taught Bess Hall to ride the mastiff?"</p>

<p>"Pray you have a care, dear Judith," said her friend,
with some apprehension on her face. "'Tis a dangerous-looking
beast."</p>

<p>"A lamb, a very lamb!" was the confident answer.
"Well, now, and as we are riding home he will tell me of
all the things he has brought from London; and you
know he has always something pretty for you, sweet Puritan,
though you regard such adornment as snares and
pitfalls. And this time I hope it will be a silver brooch
for you, dear mouse, that so you must needs wear it and
show it, or he will mark its absence; and for the others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>let us guess; let us see. There may be some more of
that strange-fashioned Murano glass for Susan, for as difficult
as it is to carry; and some silk hangings or the like
for my mother, or store of napery, perchance, which she
prizeth more; and be sure there is the newest book of
sermons from Paul's Churchyard for the Doctor; a greyhound,
should he hear of a famous one on the way, for
Thomas Combe; toys for the little Harts, that is certain;
for my aunt Joan&mdash;what?&mdash;a silver-topped jug, or some
perfumes of musk and civet?&mdash;and what else&mdash;and for
whom else&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what for yourself, dear Judith?" her friend said,
with a smile. "Will he forget you? Has Matthew gardener
driven you out even from his recollection? Will he
not have for you a pretty pair of rose shoe-strings, or one
of the new tasselled French hoods they are speaking of,
or something of the kind, that will turn the heads of all the
lads in Stratford twice further round? You are a temptress
surely, sweetheart; I half forget that such vanities
should displease me when I see the way you wear them;
and that I think you must take from your father, Judith;
for no matter how plain his apparel is&mdash;and it is plain indeed
for one that owns the New Place&mdash;he wears it with
such an ease, and with such a grace and simplicity, that
you would say a prince should wear it even so."</p>

<p>"You put me off, Prue," her friend said with a sort of
good-natured impatience. "Why, I was showing you
what nicelings and delicates my father was bringing, and
what I had thought to say was this: that he may have this
for one, and that for the other, and many a one proud to
be remembered (as I shall be if he thinks of me), but this
that I know he is bringing for little Bess Hall is something
worth all of these, for it is nothing less than the
whole love of his heart. Nay, but I swear it; there is
not a human creature in the world to compare with her
in his eyes; she is the pearl that he wears in his heart of
hearts. If it were London town she wanted, and he could
give it to her, that is what he would bring for her."</p>

<p>"What! are you jealous of her too?" said Prudence,
with her placid smile.</p>

<p>"By yea and nay, sweet Puritan, if that will content
you, I declare it is not so," was the quick answer. "Why,
Bess is my ally! We are in league, I tell you; we will have
a tussle with the enemy ere long; and, by my life, I think
I know that that will put goodman-wiseman's nose awry!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>At this moment the secret confabulation of these two
friends was suddenly and unexpectedly broken in upon
by a message from without. Something white came fluttering
through the open casement, and fell, not quite into
Judith's lap, which was probably its intended destination,
but down toward her feet. She stooped and picked
it up; it was a letter, addressed to her, and tied round
with a bit of rose-red silk ribbon that was neatly formed
into a true-lover's knot.</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE PLANTING OF THE CHARM.</h3>

<p>The embarrassment that ensued&mdash;on her part only, for
the pale and gentle face of her friend betrayed not even
so much as surprise&mdash;was due to several causes. Judith
could neither read nor write. In her earlier years she
had been a somewhat delicate child, and had consequently
been excused from the ordinary tuition, slight as that
usually was in the case of girls; but when, later on, she
grew into quite firm and robust health, in her wilfulness
and pride and petulance she refused to retransform herself
into a child and submit to be taught children's lessons.
Moreover, she had an acute and alert brain; and she had
a hundred reasons ready to show that what was in reality
a mere waywardness on her part was the most wise and
natural thing in the world; while her father, who had a
habitual and great tolerance for everything and everybody
that came within his reach, laughed with her rather
than at her, and said she should do very well without
book-learning so long as those pink roses shone in her
cheeks. But she had one reason that was not merely
an excuse. Most of the printed matter that reached the
house was brought thither by this or that curate, or by this
or that famous preacher, who, in going through the country,
was sure of an eager and respectful welcome at New
Place; and perhaps it was not kindly nor civilly done of
them&mdash;though it may have been regarded as a matter of
conscience&mdash;that they should carry thither and read aloud,
among other things, the fierce denunciations of stage-plays
and stage-players which were common in the polemical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>and puritanical literature of the day. Right or wrong,
Judith resented this with a vehement indignation; and she
put a ban upon all books, judging by what she had heard
read out of some; nay, one day she had come into the house
and found her elder sister, who was not then married, greatly
distressed, and even in the bitterness of tears; and when
she discovered that the cause of this was a pamphlet that
had been given to Susanna, in which not only were the heinous
wickednesses of plays and players denounced, but also
her own father named by his proper name, Judith, with hot
cheeks and flashing eyes, snatched the pamphlet from her
sister's hand and forthwith sent it flying through the open
window into the mud without, notwithstanding that books
and pamphlets were scarce and valuable things, and that
this one had been lent. And when she discovered that this
piece of writing had been brought to the house by the pious
and learned Walter Blaise&mdash;a youthful divine he was who
had a small living some few miles from Stratford, but who
dwelt in the town, and was one of the most eager and disputatious
of the Puritanical preachers there&mdash;it in no way
mitigated her wrath that this worthy Master Blaise was
regarded by many, and even openly spoken of, as a suitor
for her own hand.</p>

<p>"God mend me," said she, in her anger (and greatly to
the distress of the mild-spoken Prudence), "but 'tis a
strange way of paying court to a young woman to bring
into the house abuse of her own father! Sir Parson may
go hang, for me!" And for many a day she would have
nothing to say to him; and steeled and hardened her heart
not only against him, but against the doctrines and ways
of conduct that he so zealously advocated; and she would
not come in to evening prayers when he happened to be
present; and wild horses would not have dragged her to
the parish church on the Sunday afternoon that it was his
turn to deliver the fortnightly lecture there. However,
these things abated in time. Master Walter Blaise was a
civil-spoken and an earnest and sincere young man, and
Prudence Shawe was the gentle intermediary. Judith suffered
his presence, and that was about all as yet; but she
would not look the way of printed books. And when
Prudence tried to entice her into a study of the mere rudiments
of reading and writing, she would refuse peremptorily,
and say, with a laugh, that, could she read, the first
thing she should read would be plays, which, as sweet
cousin Prue was aware, were full of tribulation and anguish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>and fit only for the foolish Galatians of the world,
the children of darkness and the devil. But this obstinacy
did not prevent her overcoming her dear cousin Prue's
scruples, and getting her to read aloud to her in the privacy
of their secret haunts this or the other fragments of
a play, when that she had adroitly purloined a manuscript
from the summer-house in New Place; and in this surreptitious
manner she had acquired a knowledge of what
was going on at the Globe and the Blackfriars theatres in
London, which, had they but guessed of it, would have
considerably astounded her mother, her sister, and good
Parson Blaise as well.</p>

<p>In more delicate matters still, Prudence was her confidante,
her intermediary, and amanuensis: and ordinarily
this caused her no embarrassment, for she wished for no
secrets with any of human kind. But in one direction she
had formed certain suspicions; and so it was that on this
occasion, when she stooped down and picked up the letter
that had been so deftly thrown in at the casement, her face
flushed somewhat.</p>

<p>"I know from whom it comes," said she, and she seemed
inclined to put it into the little wallet of blue satin that
hung at her side.</p>

<p>Then she glanced at Prudence's eyes. There was nothing
there in the least approaching displeasure or pique,
only a quiet amusement.</p>

<p>"It was cleverly done," said Prudence, and she raised
her head cautiously and peeped through one of the small
panes of pale green glass. But the twilight had sunk into
dusk, and any one outside could easily have made his escape
unperceived through the labyrinth of barns and outhouses.</p>

<p>Judith glanced at the handwriting again, and said, with
an affectation of carelessness:</p>

<p>"There be those who have plenty of time, surely, for
showing the wonders of their skill. Look at the twisting
and turning and lattice-work of it&mdash;truly he is a most notable
clerk; I would he spent the daylight to better purpose.
Read it for me, sweet Prue."</p>

<p>She would have handed the letter&mdash;with much studied
indifference of look and manner&mdash;to her friend, but that
Prudence gently refused it.</p>

<p>"'Tis you must undo the string; you know not what
may be inside."</p>

<p>So Judith herself opened the letter, which contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>merely a sprig of rosemary, along with some lines written
in a most ornate calligraphy.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" she asked, but without any apparent
interest, as she gave the open letter to her companion.</p>

<p>Prudence took the letter and read aloud;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rosemary is for remembrance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Between us day and night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wishing that I might always have<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You present in my sight.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">This from your true well-wisher, and one that would be your loving servant
unto death.</p>

<p class="right">
T. Q."
</p></div>

<p>"The idle boy!" she said, and again she directed a
quick and penetrating look of inquiry to her friend's face.
But Prudence was merely regarding the elaborate handwriting.
There was no trace of wounded pride or anything
of the kind in her eyes. Nay, she looked up and
said, with a smile,</p>

<p>"For one that can wrestle so well, and play at foot-ball,
and throw the sledge as they say he can, he is master of a
most delicate handwriting."</p>

<p>"But the rosemary, Prue!" Judith exclaimed, suddenly,
and she groped about at her feet until she had found it.
"Why, now, look there, was ever anything so fortunate?
Truly I had forgotten all about rosemary, and my reverend
wizard, and the charm that is to be buried to-night; and
you know not a word of the story. Shall I tell you, sweet
mouse? Is there time before the moon appears over the
roof of the church?&mdash;for there I am summoned to fearful
deeds. Why, Prue, you look as frightened as if a ghost
had come into the room&mdash;you yourself are like a ghost now
in the dusk&mdash;or is it the coming moonlight that is making
you so pale?"</p>

<p>"I had thought that better counsels would have prevailed
with you, Judith," she said, anxiously. "I knew
not you had gone to see the man, and I reproach myself
that I have been an agent in the matter."</p>

<p>"A mouth-piece only, sweet Prue!&mdash;a mere harmless,
innocent whistle that had nothing to do with the tune.
And the business was not so dreadful either; there was no
caldron, nor playing with snakes and newts, no, nor whining
for money, which I expected most; but a most civil
and courteous wizard, a most town-bred wizard as ever the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>sun set eye on, that called me 'gracious lady' every other
moment, and would not take a penny for his pains. Marry,
if all the powers of evil be as well-behaved, I shall have less
fear of them; for a more civil-spoken gentleman I have
never encountered; and 'sweet lady' it was, and 'gracious
lady,' and a voice like the voice of my lord bishop; and
the assurance that the planets and the stars were holding
me in their kindest protection; and a promise of a ghost
husband that is to appear that I may judge whether I like
him or like him not; and all this and more&mdash;and he would
kiss my hand, and so farewell, and the reverend magician
makes his obeisance and vanishes, and I am not a penny
the poorer, but only the richer because of my charm!
There, I will show it to you, dear mouse."</p>

<p>After a little search she found the tiny document; and
Prudence Shawe glanced over it.</p>

<p>"Judith! Judith!" said she, almost in despair, "I know
not whither your wilfulness will carry you. But tell me
what happened. How came you by this paper? And
what ghost husband do you speak of?"</p>

<p>Then Judith related, with much circumstantiality, what
had occurred that morning: not toning it down in the
least, but rather exaggerating here and there; for she was
merry-hearted, and she liked to see the sweet Puritan face
grow more and more concerned. Moreover, the dull gray
light outside, instead of deepening into dark, appeared to
be becoming a trifle clearer, so that doubtless the moon
was declaring itself somewhere; and she was looking forward,
when the time came, to securing Prudence's company
as far as the church-yard, if her powers of persuasion
were equal to that.</p>

<p>"But you will not go&mdash;surely you will not go, darling
Judith," said Prudence, in accents of quite pathetic entreaty.
"You know the sin of dealing with such ungodly
practices&mdash;nay, and the danger too, for you would of your
own free will go and seek a meeting with unholy things,
whereas I have been told that not so long ago they used
in places to carry a pan of frankincense round the house
each night to keep away witchcraft from them as they
slept. I beseech you, dearest Judith, give me the paper,
and I will burn it!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, it is but an idle tale, a jest; I trust it not,"
said her friend to reassure her. "Be not afraid, sweet
Prue. Those people who go about compelling the planets
and summoning spirits and the like have lesser power than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>the village folk imagine, else would their own affairs thrive
better than they seem to do."</p>

<p>"Then give me the paper; let me burn it, Judith!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, mouse," said she, withholding it; and then
she added, with a sort of grave merriment or mischief in
her face:</p>

<p>"Whether the thing be aught or naught, sure I cannot
treat so ill my courteous wizard. He was no goose-herd,
I tell you, but a most proper and learned man; and he
must have the chance of working the wonders he foretold.
Come, now, think of it with reason, dear Prue. If there
be no power in the charm, if I go to Shottery for my
morning walk and find no one in the lane, who is harmed?
Why, no one; and Grandmother Hathaway is pleased, and
will show me how her garden is growing. Then, on the other
hand, should the charm work, should there be some one
there, what evil if I regard him as I pass from the other
side of the way? Is it such a wonder that one should meet
a stranger on the Bidford road? And what more? Man
or ghost, he cannot make me marry him if I will not.
He cannot make me speak to him if I will not. And if he
would put a hand on me, I reckon Roderigo would speedily
have him by the throat, as I hope he may some day have
goodman Matthew."</p>

<p>"But, Judith, such things are unlawful and forbidden&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To you, sweet saint&mdash;to you," said the other, with much
good-humor. "But I have not learned to put aside childish
things as yet; and this is only a jest, good Prue; and
you, that are so faithful to your word, even in the smallest
trifle, would not have me break my promise to my gentle
wizard? 'Gracious lady,' he says, and 'sweet lady,' as if I
were a dame of the court; it were unmannerly of me not
to grant him this small demand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish I had misread the letter," said Prudence, so
occupied with her own fears that she scarcely knew what
to do.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed her friend, in tones of raillery,
"you would have deceived me? Is this your honesty, your
singleness of heart, sweet Puritan? You would have sent
me on some fool's errand, would you?"</p>

<p>"And if it were to be known you had gone out to meet
this conjurer, Judith, what would your mother and sister
say?&mdash;and your father?"</p>

<p>"My mother and sister&mdash;hum!" was the demure reply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>"If he had but come in the garb of a preacher, with a
Bible under one arm and a prayer-book under the other,
I doubt not that he would have been welcome enough at
New Place&mdash;ay, and everything in the house set before him,
and a Flanders jug full of Quiney's best claret withal to
cheer the good man. But when you speak of my father,
dear Prue, there you are wide of the mark&mdash;wide, wide of
the mark; for the wizard is just such an one as he would
be anxious to know and see for himself. Indeed, if my
mother and Susan would have the house filled with preachers,
my father would rather seek his company from any
strange kind of vagrant cattle you could find on the road&mdash;ballad-singers,
strolling players, peddlers, and the like;
and you should see him when some ancient harper in his
coat of green comes near the town&mdash;nay, the constable
shall not interfere with him, license or no license&mdash;my
father must needs entertain him in the garden; and he
will sit and talk to the old man; and the best in the house
must be brought out for him; and whether he try his palsied
fingers on the strings, or perchance attempt a verse
of 'Pastime with good company' with his quavering old
voice, that is according to his own good-will and pleasure;
nothing is demanded of him but that he have good cheer,
and plenty of it, and go on his way the merrier, with a
groat or two in his pouch. Nay, I mind me, when Susan
was remonstrating with my father about such things, and
bidding him have some regard for the family name&mdash;'What?'
says he, laughing; 'set you up, Madam Pride!
Know you not, then, whence comes our name? And yet
'tis plain enough. <i>Shacks</i>, these are but vagrant, idle, useless
fellows; and then we come to <i>pere</i>, that is, an equal
and companion. There you have it complete&mdash;<i>Shackspere</i>,
the companion of strollers and vagabonds, of worthless
and idle fellows. What say you, Madam Pride?' And,
indeed, poor Susan was sorely displeased, insomuch that
I said, 'But the spear in the coat of arms, father&mdash;how
came we by that?' 'Why, there, now,' says he, 'you see
how regardless the heralds are of the King's English. I
warrant me they would give a ship to Shipston and a hen
to Enstone.' Indeed, he will jest you out of anything.
When your brother would have left the Town Council,
Prue&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here she seemed suddenly to recollect herself. She
rose quickly, thrust open the casement still wider, and put
out her head to discover whereabouts the moon was; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>when she withdrew her head again there was mischief and
a spice of excitement in her face.</p>

<p>"No more talking and gossip now, Prue; the time has
arrived for fearful deeds."</p>

<p>Prudence put her small white hand on her friend's arm.</p>

<p>"Stay, Judith. Be guided&mdash;for the love of me be guided,
sweetheart! You know not what you do. The profaning
of sacred places will bring a punishment."</p>

<p>"Profaning, say you, sweet mouse? Is it anything
worse than the children playing tick round the grave-stones;
or even, when no one is looking, having a game
of King-by-your-leave?"</p>

<p>"It is late, Judith. It must be nine o'clock. It is not
seemly that a young maiden should be out-of-doors alone
at such an hour of the night."</p>

<p>"Marry, that say I," was the light answer. "And the
better reason that you should come with me, Prue."</p>

<p>"I?" said Prudence, in affright.</p>

<p>"Wherefore not, then? Nay, but you shall suffer no
harm through the witchery, sweet mouse; I ask your
company no further than the little swing-gate. One minute
there, and I shall be back with you. Come, now, for
your friend's sake; get your hood and your muffler, dear
Prue, and no one shall know either of us from the witch
of Endor, so quickly shall we be there and back."</p>

<p>Still she hesitated.</p>

<p>"If your mother were to know, Judith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To know what, sweetheart? That you walked with
me as far as the church and back again? Why, on such
a fine and summer-like night I dare be sworn, now, that
half the good folk of Stratford are abroad; and it is no
such journey into a far country that we should take one
of the maids with us. Nay, come, sweet Prue! We shall
have a merry ride to-morrow; to-night for your friendship's
sake you must do me this small service."</p>

<p>Prudence did not answer, but somewhat thoughtfully,
and even reluctantly, she went to a small cupboard of
boxes that stood in the corner of the apartment, and
brought forth some articles of attire which (although she
might not have confessed it) were for the better disguising
of herself, seeing that the night was fine and warm.
And then Judith, having also drawn a muffler loosely
round her neck and the lower half of her face, was ready
to go, and was gone, in fact, as far as the door, when she
suddenly said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>"Why, now, I had nearly forgot the rosemary, and without
that the charm is naught. Did I leave it on the window-shelf?"</p>

<p>She went back and found it, and this time she took the
precaution of folding it within the piece of paper that she
was to bury in the church-yard.</p>

<p>"Is it fair, dear Judith?" Prudence said, reproachfully,
before she opened the door. "Is it right that you should
take the bit of rosemary sent you by one lover, and use it
as a charm to bring another?"</p>

<p>"Nay, why should you concern yourself, sweet mouse?"
said Judith, with a quick glance, but indeed at this end of
the room it was too dark for her to see anything. "My
lover, say you? Let that be as the future may show. In
the meantime I am pledged to no one, nor anxious that I
should be so. And a scrap of rosemary, now, what is it?
But listen to this, dear Prue: if it help to show me the
man I shall marry&mdash;if there be aught in this magic&mdash;will
it not be better for him that sent the rosemary that we
should be aware of what is in store for us?"</p>

<p>"I know not&mdash;I scarcely ever know&mdash;whether you are
in jest or in earnest, Judith," her friend said.</p>

<p>"Why, then, I am partly in starched cambric, good
mouse, if you must know, and partly in damask, and partly
in taffeta of popinjay blue. But come, now, let us be
going. The awful hour approaches, Prue. Do you not
tremble, like Faustus in the cell? What was't he said?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It strikes; it strikes. Now, body, turn to air!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Come along, sweet Prue."</p>

<p>But she was silent as they left. Indeed, they went down
the dark little staircase and out at the front door with as
little noise as might be. Judith had not been mistaken:
the fine, clear, warm evening had brought out many people;
and they were either quietly walking home or standing
in dusky little groups at the street corners talking to
each other; whilst here and there came a laugh from a
ruddy-windowed ale-house; and here and there a hushed
sound of singing, where a casement had been left a bit
open, told that the family within were at their devotional
exercises for the night. The half-moon was now clear and
silvery in the heavens. As they passed under the massive
structure of the Guild Chapel the upper portions of the
tall windows had a pale greenish glow shining through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>them that made the surrounding shadows look all the more
solemn. Whether it was that their mufflers effectually
prevented their being recognized, or whether it was that
none of their friends happened to be abroad, they passed
along without attracting notice from any one, nor was a
word spoken between themselves for some time.</p>

<p>But when they drew near to the church, the vast bulk
of which, towering above the trees around, seemed almost
black against the palely clear sky, the faithful Prudence
made bold to put in a final word of remonstrance and dissuasion.</p>

<p>"It is wickedness and folly, Judith. Naught can come
of such work," she said.</p>

<p>"Then let naught come of it, and what harm is done?"
her companion said, gayly. "Dear mouse, are you so timorous?
Nay, but you shall not come within the little gate;
you shall remain without. And if the spirits come and
snatch me, as they snatched off Doctor Faustus, you shall
see all the pageant, and not a penny to pay. What was it
in the paper?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Pinch him black, and pinch him blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seeks to steal a lover true!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Did it not run so? But they cannot pinch you, dear heart;
so stand here now, and hush!&mdash;pray do not scream if you
see them whip me off in a cloud of fire&mdash;and I shall be
with you again in a minute."</p>

<p>She passed through the little swinging gate and entered
the church-yard, casting therewith a quick glance around.
Apparently no one was within sight of her, either among
the gray stones or under the black-stemmed elms by the
river; but there were people not far off, for she could hear
their voices&mdash;doubtless they were going home through the
meadows on the other side of the stream. She looked but
once in that direction. The open country was lying pale
and clear in the white light; and under the wide branches
of the elms one or two bats were silently darting to and
fro; but she could not see the people, and she took it for
granted that no one could now observe what she was about.
So she left the path, made her way through the noiseless
grass, and reached the small yew-tree standing there among
the grave-stones. The light was clear enough to allow her
to open the package and make sure that the sprig of rosemary
was within; then she rapidly, with her bare hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>stooped down and scooped a little of the earth away; she
imbedded the packet there, repeating meanwhile the magic
words; she replaced the earth, and brushed the long grass
over it, so that, indeed, as well as she could make out, the
spot looked as if it had not been disturbed in any manner.
And then, with a quick look toward the roof of the church
to satisfy herself that all the conditions had been fulfilled,
she got swiftly back to the path again, and so to the little
gate, passing through the church-yard like a ghost.</p>

<p>"The deed is done, good Prue," said she, gayly, but in a
tragic whisper, as she linked her arm within the arm of her
friend and set out homeward. "Now are the dark powers
of the earth at league to raise me up&mdash;what think you,
sweetheart?&mdash;such a gallant as the world ne'er saw! Ah!
now when you see him come riding in from Shottery, will
not the town stare? None of your logget-playing, tavern-jesting,
come-kiss-me-Moll lovers, but a true-sworn knight
on his white war steed, in shining mail, with a golden
casque on his head and ostrich feathers, and on his silver
shield 'St. George and England!'"</p>

<p>"You are light-hearted, Judith," said the timid and gentle-voiced
Puritan by her side; "and in truth there is
nothing that you fear. Well, I know not, but it will be in
my prayers that no harm come of this night."</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>A PAGEANT.</h3>

<p>On the morning after the arrival of Judith's father he
was out and abroad with his bailiff at an early hour, so that
she had no chance of speaking to him; and when he returned
to New Place he went into the summer-house in
the orchard, where it was the general habit and custom to
leave him undisturbed. And yet she only wished to ask
permission to take the mastiff with her as far as Shottery;
and so, when she had performed her share of the domestic
duties, and got herself ready, she went out through the
back court and into the garden, thinking that he would not
mind so brief an interruption.</p>

<p>It was a fresh and pleasant morning, for there had been
some rain in the night, and now there was a slight breeze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>blowing from the south, and the air was sweet with the
scent of the lilac bushes. The sun lay warm on the pink
and white blossoms of the apple-trees and on the creamy
masses of the cherry; martins were skimming and shooting
this way and that, with now and again a rapid flight to
the eaves of the barn; the bees hummed from flower to
flower, and everywhere there was a chirping, and twittering,
and clear singing of birds. The world seemed full of
light and color, of youth, and sweet things, and gladness:
on such a morning she had no fear of a refusal, nor was she
much afraid to go near the summer-house that the family
were accustomed to hold sacred from intrusion.</p>

<p>But when she passed into the orchard, and came in sight
of it, there was a sudden flash of anger in her eyes. She
might have guessed&mdash;she might have known. There,
blocking up the doorway of the latticed and green-painted
tenement, was the figure of goodman Matthew; and the
little bandy-legged pippin-faced gardener was coolly resting
on his spade while he addressed his master within.
Was there ever (she asked herself) such hardihood, such
audacity and impertinence? And then she rapidly bethought
her that now was a rare opportunity for putting
in practice a scheme of revenge that she had carefully
planned. It is true that she might have gone forward and
laid her finger on Matthew's arm (he was rather deaf), and
so have motioned him away. But she was too proud to do
that. She would dispossess and rout him in another fashion.
So she turned and went quickly again into the house.</p>

<p>Now at this time Dr. Hall was making a round of professional
visits at some distance away in the country; and
on such occasions Susanna Hall and her little daughter
generally came to lodge at New Place, where Judith was
found to be an eager and assiduous, if somewhat impatient
and unreasoning, nurse, playmate, and music-mistress. In
fact, the young mother had to remonstrate with her sister,
and to point out that, although baby Elizabeth was a wonder
of intelligence and cleverness&mdash;indeed, such a wonder
as had never hitherto been beheld in the world&mdash;still, a
child of two years and three months or so could not be expected
to learn everything all at once; and that it was just as
reasonable to ask her to play on the lute as to imagine that
she could sit on the back of Don the mastiff without being
held. However, Judith was fond of the child, and that incomparable
and astute small person had a great liking for
her aunt (in consequence of benefits received), and a trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>in her which the wisdom of maturer years might have
modified; and so, whenever she chose, Judith found no
difficulty in obtaining possession of this precious charge,
even the young mother showing no anxiety when she saw
the two go away together.</p>

<p>So it was on this particular morning that Judith went
and got hold of little Bess Hall, and quickly smartened up
her costume, and carried her out into the garden. Then
she went into the barn, outside of which was the dog's
kennel; she unclasped the chain and set free the huge,
slow-stepping, dun-colored beast, that seemed to know as
well as any one what was going forward; she affixed to his
collar two pieces of silk ribbon that did very well for reins;
and then she sat little Bess Hall on Don Roderigo's back,
and gave her the reins to hold, and so they set out for the
summer-house.</p>

<p>On that May morning the wide and gracious realm of
England&mdash;which to some minds, and especially at that particular
season of the year, seems the most beautiful country
of any in the world&mdash;this rich and variegated England
lay basking in the sunlight, with all its lush meadows and
woods and hedges in the full and fresh luxuriance of the
spring; and the small quiet hamlets were busy in a drowsy
and easy-going kind of fashion; and far away around the
white coasts the blue sea was idly murmuring in; but it
may be doubted whether in all the length and breadth of
that fair land there was any fairer sight than this that the
wit of a young woman had devised. She herself was pleasant
enough to look on (and she was always particularly attentive
about her attire when her father was at home), and
now she was half laughing as she thought of her forthcoming
revenge; she had dressed her little niece in her
prettiest costume of pink and white, and pink was the
color of the silken reins; while the great slow-footed Don
bore his part in the pageant with a noble majesty, sometimes
looking up at Judith as if to ask whether he were
going in the right direction. And so the procession
passed on between the white-laden cherry-trees and the
redder masses of the apple-blossom; and the miniature
Ariadne, sitting sideways on the back of the great beast,
betrayed no fear whatsoever; while her aunt Judith held
her, walking by her, and scolding her for that she would
not sing.</p>

<p>"Tant sing, Aunt Judith," said she.</p>

<p>"You can sing well enough, you little goose, if you try,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>said her aunt, with the unreasoning impatience of an unmarried
young woman. "What's the use of your going
hunting without a hunting song? Come along, now:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The hunt is up, the hunt is up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it is well-nigh day;&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">try it, Bess!"</p>

<p>"Hunt is up, hunt is up," said the small rider; but she
was occupied with the reins, and clearly did not want to
be bothered.</p>

<p>"No, no, that is not singing, little goose. Why, sing it
like this, now:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The hunt is up, the hunt is up,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And it is well-nigh day;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Harry our king is gone hunting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bring his deer to bay!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">However, the music lesson came to an abrupt end. They
had by this time almost reached the summer-house. Saturnine
Matthew, gardener, who still stood there, blocking
up the doorway, had not heard them approach, but his
master within had. The next instant goodman Matthew
suddenly found himself discarded, dismissed, and treated,
indeed, as if he were simply non-existent in the world;
for Judith's father, having paused for a moment to regard
from the doorway the pretty pageant that had been arranged
for him (and his face lit up, as it were, with pleasure
at the sight), was the next minute down beside his
little granddaughter, with one knee on the ground, so that
he was just on a level with her outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"What, Bess?" he said, as he caught her by both hands
and feet. "You imp, you inch, you elfin queen, you!&mdash;would
you go a-hunting, then?"</p>

<p>"Send away Don&mdash;me want to ride the high horse,"
said the small Bess, who had her own ideas as to what was
most comfortable, and also secure.</p>

<p>"And so you shall, you sprite, you Ariel, you moonlight
wonder!" he exclaimed, as he perched her on his shoulder
and rose to his feet again. "The high horse, truly;
indeed, you shall ride the high horse! Come, now, we will
go see how the King's mulberry thrives; that is the only
tree we have that is younger than yourself, you ancient,
you beldame, you witch of Endor, you!"</p>

<p>"Father," said Judith, seeing that he was going away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>perfectly regardless of anybody or anything except his
granddaughter, "may I take the Don with me for an hour
or so?"</p>

<p>"Whither away, wench&mdash;whither?" he asked, turning
for a moment.</p>

<p>"To Shottery, father."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he, and he turned again and went off.</p>

<p>"Come, Bess, you world's jewel, you, you shall ride
with me to London some day, and tell the King how his
mulberry thrives; that shall you, you fairy, you princess,
you velvet-footed maidiekin! To London, Bess&mdash;to London!"</p>

<p>Judith did not stay to regard them further; but she
could not help casting a look before she left at goodman
Matthew, who stood there discomfited, dispossessed, unheeded,
annihilated, as it were. And then, calling the dog
after her, she went in by the back court and through the
house again (for Chapel Lane was in a sad condition after
the rain of the night, and was not a pleasant pathway even
in the best of times). And she was laughing to herself at
Matthew's discomfiture, and she was singing to herself as
she went out by the front door,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's never a maid in all the town,<br /></span>

<p class="noi">And in the street it was "Good-morrow to you, Master
Jelleyman; the rain will do good, will it not?" and, again,
"Good-morrow, Neighbor Pike; do you know that my
father is come home?" and again, "Get you within the
doorway, little Parsons, else the wagon-wheels will be
over thee." And then, when she was in the freedom of the
fields, she would talk blithely to Don Roderigo, or snatch
a buttercup here or there from among the long, lush, warm
grass, or return to her careless singing:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>IN A WOODED LANE.</h3>

<p>Now it would be extremely difficult to say with what
measure of faith or scepticism, of expectation or mere curiosity,
she was now proceeding through these meadows to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>the spot indicated to her by the wizard. Probably she
could not have told herself, for what was really uppermost
in her mind was a kind of malicious desire to frighten her
timid Puritan friend with the wildness of such an adventure.
And then she was pretty safe. Ostensibly she
was going to Shottery to pay a visit to her grandmother;
to look at the pansies, the wall-flowers, the forget-me-nots
in the little garden, and see how the currants and raspberries
were getting on. She could hardly expect a ghost
to rise from the ground in broad daylight. And if any
mere strangers happened to be coming along the lane
leading in from the Bidford road, Don Roderigo was a sufficient
guardian. On the other hand, if there was anything
real and of verity in this witchcraft&mdash;which had sought
her, and not she it&mdash;was it not possible that the wizard
might on one point have been mistaken? If her future
husband were indeed to appear, would it not be much more
likely to be Parson Blaise or Tom Quiney, or young Jelleyman,
or one or other of them that she knew in everyday
life? But yet she said to herself&mdash;and there was no doubt
about her absolute conviction and certainty on this point&mdash;that,
even if she were to meet one of those coming in
from Evesham, not all the magic and mystery and wizardry
in the world would drive her to marry him but of her own
free good-will and choice.</p>

<p>When she had passed through the meadows and got near
to the scattered cottages and barns and orchards of the
little hamlet, instead of going forward to these, she bore
away to the left, and eventually found herself in a wide
and wooded lane. She was less light of heart now; she
wished the place were not so still and lonely. It was a
pretty lane, this; the ruddy-gray road that wound between
luxuriant hedges and tall elms was barred across by alternate
sunlight and shadow, and every now and again she
had glimpses of the rich and fertile country lying around,
with distant hills showing an outline serrated by trees
along the pale, summer-like sky. But there was not a human
being visible anywhere, nor a sound to be heard but
the soft repeated note of the cuckoo. She wished that
there were some farm people near at hand, or a shepherd
lad, or anybody. She spoke to Roderigo, and her voice
sounded strange&mdash;it sounded as if she were afraid some
one was listening. Nay, she began, quite unreasonably,
to be angry with the wizard. What business had
he to interfere with her affairs, and to drive her on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>such foolish enterprises? What right had he to challenge
her to show that she was not afraid? She was not afraid,
she assured herself. She had as good a title to walk along
this lane as any one in Warwickshire. Only the thought
that as soon as she had got as far as the cross at the meeting
of the roads (this was all that had been demanded of
her) she would go back to Stratford by the public highway
rather than return by this solitary lane, for on the public
highway there would be farm servants and laden wains
and carriers, and such-like comfortable and companionable
objects.</p>

<p>The next minute&mdash;she had almost reached the cross&mdash;her
heart bounded with an unreasoning tremor of fear:
she had suddenly become aware that a stranger was entering
the lane from the wide highway beyond. She had
only one glimpse of him, for instantly and resolutely she
bent her eyes on Don Roderigo, and was determined to
keep them there until this person should have passed; and
yet that one lightning-like glimpse had told her somewhat.
The stranger was young, and of a distinguished
bearing and presence; and it certainly was a singular and
unusual thing that a gentleman (as he seemed to be, although
his travelling cloak concealed most of his attire)
should be going afoot and unattended. But her only concern
was to let him pass. Ghost or man as he might be,
she kept her eyes on Don Roderigo. And then, to her increased
alarm, she found that the stranger was approaching
her.</p>

<p>"I beseech your pardon, lady," said he, in a most respectful
voice, "but know you one in this town of the name of
Master Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>She certainly was startled, and even inwardly aghast;
but she had a brave will. She was determined that nothing
would drive her either to scream or to run away. And
indeed when she looked up and said, rather breathlessly,
"There be several of the name, sir," she was quickly assured
that this was no ghost at all, but a substantial and
living and breathing young man, tall and dark, of a pleasant
expression of face, though in truth there was nothing
in those singularly black eyes of his but the most ordinary
and matter-of-fact inquiry.</p>

<p>"One Master William Shakespeare," said he, in answer
to her, "that is widely known."</p>

<p>"It is my father, sir, you speak of," said she, hastily
and, in fact, somewhat ashamed of her fright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p><p>At this news he removed his hat and made her a gracious
obeisance, yet simply, and with not too elaborate a courtesy.</p>

<p>"Since I am so fortunate," said he, "may I beg you to
direct me how I shall find the house when I get to the
town? I have a letter for him, as you may see."</p>

<p>He took out a letter, and held it so that, if she liked, she
might read the superscription&mdash;"<i>To my loving good friend
Master William Shakespeare: Deliver these.</i>" But Judith
merely glanced at the writing.</p>

<p>"'Tis from Master Ben Jonson&mdash;that you know of, doubtless,
madam&mdash;commending me to your father. But perhaps,"
he added, directing toward her a curious timid look
of inquiry, "it were as well that I did not deliver it?"</p>

<p>"How so, sir?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am one that is in misfortune," said he, simply; "nay,
in peril."</p>

<p>"Truly I am sorry for that, sir," said she, regarding him
with frank eyes of sympathy, for indeed there was a kind
of sadness in his air, that otherwise was distinguished
enough, and even noble. And then she added: "But
surely that is the greater reason you should seek my
father."</p>

<p>"If I dared&mdash;if I knew," he said, apparently to himself.
And then he addressed her: "If I make so bold, sweet
lady, as to ask you if your father be of the ancient faith&mdash;or
well disposed toward that, even if he do not openly profess
it&mdash;I pray you set it down to my need and hard circumstances."</p>

<p>She did not seem to understand.</p>

<p>"I would ask if he be not at heart with the Catholic gentlemen
that are looking for better times&mdash;for indeed I have
heard it stated of him."</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir&mdash;surely not," said Judith, in some alarm, for
she knew quite enough about the penal laws against priests
and recusants, and would not have her father associated in
any way with these, especially as she was talking with a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Nay, then, it were better I did not deliver the letter,"
said the young man, with just a touch of hopelessness in
his tone. "Under the protection of your father I might
have had somewhat more of liberty, perchance; but I am
content to remain as I am until I can get proofs that will
convince them in authority of my innocence; or mayhap
I may get away from the country altogether, and to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>friends in Flanders. If they would but set my good friend
Walter Raleigh free from the Tower, that also were well,
for he and I might make a home for ourselves in another
land. I crave your pardon for detaining you, madam, and
so bid you farewell."</p>

<p>He raised his hat and made her a most respectful obeisance,
and was about to withdraw.</p>

<p>"Stay, sir," said she, scarcely knowing what she said,
but with trouble and anxiety in her gentle eyes.</p>

<p>Indeed, she was somewhat bewildered. So sudden had
been the shock of surprise that she had forgotten, or very
nearly forgotten, all about ghosts and wizards, about possible
lovers or husbands, and only knew that here, in actual
fact, was a stranger&mdash;and a modest young stranger,
too&mdash;that was in trouble, and yet was afraid to seek shelter
and aid from her father. That he had no reason to be thus
afraid she was certain enough; and yet she dare not assume&mdash;she
had no reason for believing&mdash;that her father
was secretly inclined to favor those that were still hoping
for the re-establishment of the Catholic faith. The fact
was that her father scarcely ever spoke of such matters.
He would listen, if he happened to be in the house, to any
theological discussion that might be going on, and he
would regard this or that minister or preacher calmly, as
if trying to understand the man and his opinions; but he
would take no part in the talk; and when the discussion
became disputatious, as sometimes happened, and the combatants
grew warm and took to making hot assertions, he
would rise and go out idly into the garden, and look at the
young apple-trees or talk to Don Roderigo. Indeed, at
this precise moment, Judith was quite incapable of deciding
for herself which party her father would most likely
be in sympathy with&mdash;the Puritans, who were sore at
heart because of the failure of the Hampton Court Conference,
or the Catholics, who were no less bitter on account
of the severity of the penal laws&mdash;and a kind of
vague wish arose in her heart that she could ask Prudence
Shawe (who paid more attention to such matters, and was,
in fact, wrapped up in them) before sending this young
man away with his letter of commendation unopened.</p>

<p>"Your brother-in-law, madam, Dr. Hall," said he, seeing
that she did not wish him to leave on the instant, "is well
esteemed by the Catholic gentry, as I hear."</p>

<p>Judith did not answer that; she had been rapidly considering
what she could do for one in distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>"By your leave, sir, I would not have you go away without
making further inquiry," said she. "I will myself get
to know how my father is inclined, for indeed he never
speaks of such matters to us; and sure I am that, whatever
be his opinion, no harm could come to you through
seeking his friendship. That I am sure of. If you are in
distress, that is enough; he will not ask you whence you
come; nor has he censure for any one; and that is a marvel
in one that is so good a man himself, that he hath
never a word of blame for any one, neither for the highwayman
that was taken red-handed, as it were, last Sunday
near to Oxford&mdash;'Why,' says my father, 'if he take
not life, and be a civil gentleman, I grudge him not a
purse or two'&mdash;nor for a lesser criminal, my cousin Willie
Hart, that but yesterday let the Portuguese singing-bird
escape from its cage. 'Well, well,' says my father, 'so
much the better, if only it can find food for itself.' Indeed,
you need fear naught but kindness and gentleness;
and sure I am that he would be but ill pleased to know
that one coming from his friend Benjamin Jonson had been
in the neighborhood and gone away without having speech
of him."</p>

<p>"But this is no matter of courtesy, sweet lady," said he.
"It is of a more dangerous cast; and I must be wary. If,
now, you were inclined to do as you say&mdash;to make some
discreet inquiry as to your good father's sentiments&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not from himself," said she, quickly, and with some
color mounting to her cheeks&mdash;"for he would but laugh
at my speaking of such things&mdash;but from my gossip and
neighbor I think I could gain sufficient assurance that
would set your fears at rest."</p>

<p>"And how should I come to know?" he said, with some
hesitation&mdash;for this looked much like asking for another
meeting.</p>

<p>But Judith was frank enough. If she meant to confer a
kindness, she did not stay to be too scrupulous about the
manner of doing it.</p>

<p>"If it were convenient that you could be here this evening,"
said she, after a moment's thought, "Willie Hart and
myself often walk over to Shottery after supper. Then
could I let you know."</p>

<p>"But how am I to thank you for such a favor?" said he.</p>

<p>"Nay, it is but little," she answered, "to do for one that
comes from my father's friend."</p>

<p>"Rare Ben, as they call him," said he, more brightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>"And now I bethink me, kind lady, that it ill becomes me
to have spoken of nothing but my own poor affairs on my
first having the honor of meeting with you. Perchance
you would like to hear something of Master Jonson, and
how he does? May I accompany you on your homeward
way for a space, if you are returning to the town? The
road here is quiet enough for one that is in hiding, as well
as for pleasant walking; and you are well escorted, too,"
he added, looking at the grave and indifferent Don. "With
such a master as your father, and such a sweet mistress, I
should not wonder if he became as famous as Sir John
Harrington's Bungey that the Prince asked about. You
have not heard of him?&mdash;the marvellous dog that Sir John
would intrust with messages all the way to the court at
Greenwich; and he would bring back the answer without
more ado. I wonder not that Prince Henry should have
asked for an account of all his feats and doings."</p>

<p>Now insensibly she had turned and begun to walk toward
Shottery (for she would not ask this unhappy young man
to court the light of the open highway), and as he respectfully
accompanied her his talk became more and more
cheerful, so that one would scarcely have remembered
that he was in hiding, and in peril of his life mayhap.
And he quickly found that she was most interested in Jonson
as being her father's friend and intimate.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I should not much marvel to hear of his being
soon in this very town of Stratford," said he, "for he has
been talking of late&mdash;nay, he has been talking this many
a day of it, but who knows when the adventure will take
place?&mdash;of travelling all the way to Scotland on foot, and
writing an account of his discoveries on the road. And
then he has a mind to get to the lake of Lomond, to make
it the scene of a fisher and pastoral play, he says; and his
friend Drummond will go with him; and they speak of
getting still farther to the north, and being the guests
of the new Scotch lord, Mackenzie of Kintail, that was
made a peer last winter. Nay, friend Ben, though at times
he gibes at the Scots, at other times he will boast of his
Scotch blood&mdash;for his grandfather, as I have heard, came
from Annandale&mdash;and you will often hear him say that
whereas the late Queen was a niggard and close-fisted,
this Scotch King is lavish and a generous patron. If he
go to Scotland, as is his purpose, surely he will come by
way of Stratford."</p>

<p>"It were ill done of him else," said Judith. But truly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>this young gentleman was so bent on entertaining her
with tales of his acquaintance in London, and with descriptions
of the court shows and pageants, that she had
not to trouble herself much to join in the conversation.</p>

<p>"A lavish patron the King has been to him truly," he continued,
stooping to pat the Don's head, as if he would
make friends with him too, "what with the masks, and
revels, and so forth. Their last tiltings at Prince Henry's
barriers exceeded everything that had gone before, as I
think&mdash;and I marvel not that Ben was found at his best,
seeing how the King had been instructing him. Nay, but
it was a happy conceit to have our young Lord of the
Isles addressed by the Lady of the Lake, and have King
Arthur hand him his armor out of the clouds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But where was it, good sir?" said she (to show that she
was interested). And now he seemed so cheerful and
friendly that she ventured to steal a look at him. In truth,
there was nothing very doleful or tragic in his appearance.
He was a handsomely made young man, of about eight-and-twenty
or so, with fine features, a somewhat pale and
sallow complexion (that distinguished him markedly from
the rustic red and white and sun-brown she was familiar
with), and eyes of a singular blackness and fire that were
exceedingly respectful; but that could, as any one might
see, easily break into mirth. He was well habited too, for
now he had partly thrown his travelling cloak aside, and
his slashed doublet and hose and shoes were smart and
clearly of a town fashion. He wore no sword; in his belt
there was only a small dagger, of Venetian silver-work on
the handle, and with a sheath of stamped crimson velvet.</p>

<p>"Dear lady, you must have heard of them," he continued,
lightly&mdash;"I mean of the great doings in the banqueting-house
at Whitehall, when Prince Henry challenged so
many noble lords. 'Twas a brave sight, I assure you; the
King and Queen were there, and the ambassadors from
Spain and Venice, and a great and splendid assemblage.
And then, when Ben's speeches came to be spoken, there
was Cyril Davy, that is said to have the best woman's
voice in London, as the Lady of the Lake, and he came
forward and said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lest any yet should doubt, or might mistake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Nymph I am, behold the ample Lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which I'm styled; and near it Merlin's tomb;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and then King Arthur appeared, and our young Lord of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>the Isles had a magic shield handed to him. Oh, 'twas a
noble sight, I warrant you! And I heard that the Duke
of Lennox and the Earls of Arundel and Southampton
and all of them were but of one mind, that friend Ben
had never done better."</p>

<p>Indeed, the young man, as they loitered along the
pretty wooded lane in the hush of the warm still noon
(there was scarce enough wind to make a rustle in the
great branching elms), and as he talked of all manner of
things for the entertainment of this charming companion
whom a happy chance had thrown in his way, seemed to
be well acquainted with the court and its doings, and all
the busy life of London. If she gathered rightly, he had
himself been present when the King and the nobles went
in the December of the previous year to Deptford to witness
the launching of the great ship of the East India
Company&mdash;the <i>Trade's Encrease</i>, it was called&mdash;for he described
the magnificent banquet in the chief cabin, and
how the King gave to Sir Thomas Smith, the Governor, a
fine chain of gold, with his portrait set in a jewel, and
how angry his Majesty became when they found that the
ship could not be launched on account of the state of the
tide. But when he again brought in the name of Jonson,
and said how highly the King thought of his writings,
and what his Majesty had said of this or the other device
or masque that had been commanded of him, Judith grew
at length to be not so pleased; and she said, with some
asperity, "But the King holds my father in honor also,
for he wrote him a letter with his own hand."</p>

<p>"I heard not of that," said he, but of course without
appearing to doubt her word.</p>

<p>"Nay, but I saw it," said she&mdash;"I saw the letter; and I
did not think it well that my father should give it to Julius
Shawe, for there are some others that would have valued
it as much as he&mdash;yes, and been more proud of it, too."</p>

<p>"His own daughter, perchance?" he said gently.</p>

<p>Judith did not speak. It was a sore subject with her;
indeed, she had cried in secret, and bitterly, when she
learned that the letter had been casually given away, for
her father seemed to put no great store by it. However,
that had nothing to do with this unhappy young gentleman
that was in hiding. And soon she had dismissed it
from her mind, and was engaged in fixing the exact time
at which, as she hoped, she would be able to bring him
that assurance, or that caution, in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>"I think it must be the province of women to be kind
to the unfortunate," said he, as they came in sight of the
cottages; and he seemed to linger and hesitate in his walk,
as if he were afraid of going further.</p>

<p>"It is but a small kindness," said she; "and I hope it
will bring you and my father together. He has but just
returned from London, and you will not have much news
to give him from his friend; but you will be none the
less welcome, for all are welcome to him, but especially
those whom he can aid."</p>

<p>"If I were to judge of the father by the daughter, I
should indeed expect a friendly treatment," said he, with
much courtesy.</p>

<p>"Nay, but it is so simple a matter," said she.</p>

<p>"Then fare you well, Mistress Judith," said he, "if I may
make so bold as to guess at a name that I have heard named
in London."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir?" said she, glancing up with some inquiry.</p>

<p>"But indeed, indeed," said he, gallantly. "And who
can wonder? 'Twas friend Ben that I heard speak of
you; I marvel not that he carried your praises so far.
But now, sweet lady, that I see you would go&mdash;and I wish
not to venture nearer the village there&mdash;may I beseech of
you at parting a further grace and favor? It is that you
would not reveal to any one, no matter what trust you
may put in them, that you have seen me or spoken with
me. You know not my name, it is true, though I would
willingly confide it to you&mdash;indeed, it is Leofric Hope,
madam; but if it were merely known that you had met
with a stranger, curious eyes might be on the alert."</p>

<p>"Fear not, sir," said she, looking at him in her frank
way&mdash;and there was a kind of friendliness, too, and sympathy
in her regard. "Your secret is surely safe in my
keeping. I can promise you that none shall know
through me that you are in the neighborhood. Farewell,
good sir. I hope your fortunes will mend speedily."</p>

<p>"God keep you, sweet Mistress Judith," said he, raising
his hat and bowing low, and not even asking to be allowed
to take her hand. "If my ill fortune should carry
it so that I see you not again, at least I will treasure in my
memory a vision of kindness and beauty that I trust will
remain forever there. Farewell, gentle lady; I am your
debtor."</p>

<p>And so they parted; and he stood looking after her
and the great dog as they passed through the meadows;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>and she was making all the haste she might, for although,
when Judith's father was at home, the dinner hour was at
twelve instead of at eleven, still it would take her all the
time to be punctual, and she was scrupulous not to offend.
He stood looking after her as long as she was in sight,
and then he turned away, saying to himself:</p>

<p>"Why, our Ben did not tell us a tithe of the truth!&mdash;for
why?&mdash;because it was with his tongue, and not with his
pen, that he described her. By heaven, she is a marvel!&mdash;and
I dare be sworn, now, that half the clowns in Stratford
imagine themselves in love with her."</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>WITHIN-DOORS.</h3>

<p>When in the afternoon Judith sought out her gentle
gossip, and with much cautious tact and discretion began
to unfold her perplexities to her, Prudence was not only
glad enough to hear nothing further of the wizard&mdash;who
seemed to have been driven out of Judith's mind altogether
by the actual occurrences of the morning&mdash;but also
she became possessed with a secret wonder and joy; for
she thought that at last her dearest and closest friend was
awaking to a sense of the importance of spiritual things,
and that henceforth there would be a bond of confidence
between them far more true and abiding than any that
had been before. But soon she discovered that politics
had a good deal to do with these hesitating inquiries; and
at length the bewildered Prudence found the conversation
narrowing and narrowing itself to this definite question:
Whether, supposing there were a young man charged with
complicity in a Catholic plot, or perhaps having been
compromised in some former affair of the kind, and supposing
him to appeal to her father, would he, Judith's
father, probably be inclined to shelter him and conceal
him, and give him what aid was possible until he might
get away from the country?</p>

<p>"But what do you mean, Judith?" said Prudence, in
dismay. "Have you seen any one? What is't you mean?
Have you seen one of the desperate men that were concerned
with Catesby?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p><p>Indeed, it was not likely that either of these two Warwickshire
maidens had already forgotten the terrible tidings
that rang through the land but a few years before,
when the Gunpowder Treason was discovered; nor how
the conspirators fled into this very county; nor yet how
in the following January, on a bitterly cold and snowy
day, there was brought into the town the news of the executions
in St. Paul's Churchyard and at Westminster.
And, in truth, when Prudence Shawe mentioned Catesby's
name, Judith's cheek turned pale. It was but for an instant.
She banished the ungenerous thought the moment
that it occurred to her. No, she was sure the unhappy
young man who had appealed to her compassion could
not have been concerned in any such bloody enterprise.
His speech was too gentle for that. Had he not declared
that he only wanted time to prove his innocence? It is
true he had said something about his friends in Flanders,
and often enough had she heard the Puritan divines denouncing
Flanders as the very hot-bed of the machinations
of the Jesuits; but that this young man might have friends
among the Jesuits did not appear to her as being in itself
a criminal thing, any more than the possibility of his being
a Catholic was sufficient of itself to deprive him of
her frank and generous sympathy.</p>

<p>"I may not answer you yea nor nay, sweet mouse," said
she; "but assure yourself that I am not in league with
any desperate villain. I but put a case. We live in quiet
times now, do we not, good Prue? and I take it that those
who like not the country are free to leave it. But tell me,
if my father were to speak openly, which of the parties
would he most affect? And how stands he with the King?
Nay, the King himself, of what religion is he at heart,
think you?"</p>

<p>"These be questions!" said Prudence, staring aghast
at such ignorance.</p>

<p>"I but use my ears," said Judith, indifferently, "and
the winds are not more variable than the opinions that
one listens to. Well you know it, Prue. Here is one
that says the King is in conscience a papist, as his mother
was; and that he gave a guarantee to the Catholic gentry
ere he came to the throne; and that soon or late we shall
have mass again; and then comes another with the story
that the Pope is hot and angry because the King misuseth
him in his speech, calling him Antichrist and the like
and that he has complained to the French King on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>matter, and that there is even talk of excommunication.
What can one believe? How is one to know? Indeed,
good mouse, you would have me more anxious about such
things; but why should one add to one's difficulties? I
am content to be like my father, and stand aside from the
quarrel."</p>

<p>"Your wit is too great for me, dear Judith," her friend
said, rather sadly; "and I will not argue with you. But
well I know there may be a calmness that is of ignorance
and indifference, and that is slothful and sinful; and there
may be a calmness that is of assured wisdom and knowledge
of the truth, and that I trust your father has attained
to. That he should keep aside from disputes, I can well
understand."</p>

<p>"But touching the King, dear cousin," said Judith, who
had her own ends in view. "How stands my father with
the King and his religion? Nay, but I know, and every
one knows, that in all other matters they are friends; for
your brother has the King's letter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I wish you had yourself, Judith, since your heart
is set upon it," said her companion, gently.</p>

<p>Judith did not answer that.</p>

<p>"But as regards religion, sweet Prue, what think you
my father would most favor, were there a movement any
way?&mdash;a change to the ancient faith perchance?"</p>

<p>She threw out the question with a kind of studied carelessness,
as if it were a mere matter of speculation; but
there was a touch of warmth in Prudence's answer:</p>

<p>"What, then, Judith? You think he would disturb the
peace of the land, and give us over again to the priests
and their idol-worship? I trow not." Then something
seemed to occur to her suddenly. "But if you have any
doubt, Judith, I can set your mind at rest&mdash;of a surety I
can."</p>

<p>"How, then, dear mouse?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you the manner of it. No longer ago than
yesterday evening I was seated at the window reading&mdash;it
was the volume that Dr. Hall brought me from Worcester,
and that I value more and more the longer I read it&mdash;and
your father came into the house asking for Julius. So I
put the book on the table, with the face downward, and
away I went to seek for my brother. Well, then, sweet
cousin, when I came back to the room, there was your
father standing at the window reading the book that I had
left, and I would not disturb him; and when he had finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>the page, he turned, saying, 'Good bishop! good
bishop!' and putting down the book on the table just as
he had found it. Dear Judith, I hope you will think it no
harm and no idle curiosity that made me take up the book
as soon as my brother was come in, and examine the passage,
and mark it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harm!&mdash;bless thee, sweetheart!" Judith exclaimed.
And she added, eagerly: "But have you the book? Will
you read it to me? Is it about the King? Do, dear cousin,
read to me what it was that my father approved. Beshrew
me! but I shall have to take to school lessons, after
all, lest I outlive even your gentle patience."</p>

<p>Straightway Prudence had gone to a small cupboard of
boxes in which she kept all her most valued possessions,
and from thence she brought a stout little volume, which,
as Judith perceived, had a tiny book-mark of satin projecting
from the red-edged leaves.</p>

<p>"Much comfort indeed have I found in these Comfortable
Notes," said she. "I wish, Judith, you, that can
think of everything, would tell me how I am to show to
Dr. Hall that I am more and more grateful to him for his
goodness. What can I do?&mdash;words are such poor things!"</p>

<p>"But the passage, good Prue&mdash;what was't he read? I
pray you let me hear," said Judith, eagerly; for here, indeed,
might be a key to many mysteries.</p>

<p>"Listen, then," said her companion, opening the book.
"The Bishop, you understand, Judith, is speaking of the
sacrifices the Jews made to the Lord, and he goes on to
say:</p>

<p>"'Thus had this people their peace-offerings; that is,
duties of thankfulness to their God for the peace and
prosperity vouchsafed unto them. And most fit it was
that He should often be thanked for such favors. The
like mercies and goodness remain to us at this day: are
we either freed from the duty or left without means to
perform it? No, no; but as they had oxen and kine,
and sheep and goats, then appointed and allowed, so have
we the calves of our lips and the sacrifice of thanksgiving
still remaining for us, and as strictly required of us as
these (in those days) were of them. Offer them up, then,
with a free heart and with a feeling soul. Our peace is
great; our prosperity comfortable; our God most sweet
and kind; and shall we not offer? The public is sweet,
the private is sweet, and forget you to offer? We lay us
down and take our rest, and this our God maketh us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>dwell in safety. Oh, where is your offering? We rise
again and go to our labor, and a dog is not heard to move
his tongue among us: owe we no offering? O Lord, O
Lord, make us thankful to Thee for these mercies: the
whole state we live in, for the common and our several
souls, for several mercies now many years enjoyed! O
touch us; O turn us from our fearful dulness, and abusing
of this so sweet, so long, and so happy peace! Continue
thy sacred servant'&mdash;surely you know, Judith, whom
he means&mdash;'the chiefest means under Thee of this our
comfort, and ever still furnish him with wise helps, truly
fearing Thee, and truly loving him. Let our heads go to
the grave in this peace, if it may be Thy blessed pleasure,
and our eyes never see the change of so happy an estate.
Make us thankful and full of peace-offerings; be Thou
still ours, and ever merciful. Amen! Amen!'"</p>

<p>"And what said he, sweet Prue&mdash;what said my father?"
Judith asked, though her eyes were distant and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"'Good bishop! good bishop!' said he, as if he were
right well pleased, and he put down the book on the table.
Nay, you may be certain, Judith, that your father would
have naught to do with the desperate men that would fain
upset the country, and bring wars among us, and hand us
over to the Pope again. I have heard of such; I have
heard that many of the great families have but a lip loyalty,
and have malice at their heart, and would willingly
plunge the land in blood if they could put the priests in
power over us again. Be sure your father is not of that
mind."</p>

<p>"But if one were in distress, Prudence," said the other,
absently, "perchance with a false charge hanging over him
that could be disproved&mdash;say that one were in hiding, and
only anxious to prove his innocence, or to get away from
the country, is my father likely to look coldly on such a
one in misfortune? No, no, surely, sweet mouse!"</p>

<p>"But of whom do you speak, Judith?" exclaimed her
friend, regarding her with renewed alarm. "It cannot be
that you know of such a one? Judith, I beseech you speak
plainly! You have met with some stranger that is unknown
to your own people? You said you had but put a case,
but now you speak as if you knew the man. I beseech
you, for the love between us, speak plainly to me, Judith!"</p>

<p>"I may not," said the other rising. And then she added,
more lightly, "Nay, have no fear, sweet Prue; if there be
any danger, it is not I that run it, and soon there will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>no occasion for my withholding the secret from you, if
secret there be."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you, Judith," said her friend, with
the pale, gentle face full of a tender wistfulness and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Such timid eyes!" said Judith, laughing good-naturedly.
"Indeed, Prudence, I have seen no ghost, and goodman
Wizard has failed me utterly; nor sprite nor phantom
has been near me. In sooth I have buried poor Tom's bit
of rosemary to little purpose. And now I must get me
home, for Master Parson comes this afternoon, and I will
but wait the preaching to hear Susan sing: 'tis worth the
penance. Farewell, sweet mouse; get you rid of your
alarm. The sky will clear all in good time."</p>

<p>So they kissed each other, and she left; still in much
perplexity, it is true, but nevertheless resolved to tell the
young man honestly and plainly the result of her inquiries.</p>

<p>As it turned out, she was to hear something more about
the King and politics and religion that afternoon; for when
she got home to New Place, Master Blaise was already
there, and he was eagerly discussing with Judith's mother
and her sister the last news that had been brought from
London; or rather he was expounding it, with emphatic
assertions and denunciations that the women-folk received
for the most part with a mute but quite apparent sympathy.
He was a young man of about six-and-twenty, rather inclined
to be stout, but with strongly lined features, fair complexion
and hair, an intellectual forehead, and sharp and
keen gray eyes. The one point that recommended him to
Judith's favor&mdash;which he openly and frankly, but with perfect
independence, sought&mdash;was the uncompromising manner
in which he professed his opinions. These frequently
angered her, and even at times roused her to passionate
indignation; and yet, oddly enough, she had a kind of lurking
admiration for the very honesty that scorned to curry
favor with her by means of any suppression or evasion. It
may be that there was a trace of the wisdom of the serpent
in this attitude of the young parson, who was shrewd-headed
as well as clear-eyed, and was as quick as any to read the
fearless quality of Judith's character. At all events, he
would not yield to any of her prejudices; he would not
stoop to flatter her; he would not abate one jot of his protests
against the vanity and pride, the heathenish show and
extravagance, of women; the heinousness and peril of indifferentism
in matters of doctrine; and the sinfulness of
the life of them that countenanced stage plays and such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>like devilish iniquities. It was this last that was the real
stumbling-block and contention between them. Sometimes
Judith's eyes burned. Once she rose and got out
of the room. "If I were a man, Master Parson," she was
saying to herself, with shut teeth, "by the life of me I
would whip you from Stratford town to Warwick!" And
indeed there was ordinarily a kind of armed truce between
these two, so that no stranger or acquaintance could very
easily decide what their precise relations were, although
every one knew that Judith's mother and sister held the
young divine in great favor, and would fain have had him
of the family.</p>

<p>At this moment of Judith's entrance he was much exercised,
as has been said, on account of the news that was but
just come from London&mdash;how that the King was driving at
still further impositions because of the Commons begrudging
him supplies; and naturally Master Blaise warmly approved
of the Commons, that had been for granting the
liberties to the Puritans which the King had refused. And
not only was this the expression of a general opinion on
the subject, but he maintained as an individual&mdash;and as a
very emphatic individual too&mdash;that the prerogatives of the
crown, the wardships and purveyances and what not, were
monstrous and abominable, and a way of escape from the
just restraint of Parliament, and he declared with a sudden
vehemence that he would rather perish at the stake than
contribute a single benevolence to the royal purse. Judith's
mother, a tall, slight, silver-haired woman, with eyes
that had once been of extraordinary beauty, but now were
grown somewhat sad and worn, and her daughter Susanna
Hall, who was darker than her sister Judith as regarded
hair and eyebrows, but who had blue-gray eyes of a singular
clearness and quickness and intelligence, listened and
acquiesced; but perhaps they were better pleased when
they found the young parson come out of that vehement
mood; though still he was sharp of tongue and sarcastic,
saying as an excuse for the King that now he was revenging
himself on the English Puritans for the treatment he
had received at the hands of the Scotch Presbyterians, who
had harried him not a little. He had not a word for Judith;
he addressed his discourse entirely to the other two. And
she was content to sit aside, for indeed this discontent with
the crown on the part of the Puritans was nothing strange
or novel to her, and did not in the least help to solve her
present perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p><p>And now the maids (for Judith's father would have no
serving-men, nor stable-men, nor husbandmen of any grade
whatever, come within-doors; the work of the house was
done entirely by women-folk) entered to prepare the long
oaken table for supper, seeing which Master Blaise suggested
that before that meal it might be as well to devote
a space to divine worship. So the maids were bidden to
stay their preparations, and to remain, seating themselves
dutifully on a bench brought crosswise, and the others sat
at the table in their usual chairs, while the preacher opened
the large Bible that had been fetched for him, and proceeded
to read the second chapter of the Book of Jeremiah,
expounding as he went along. This running commentary
was, in fact, a sermon applied to all the evils of the day, as
the various verses happened to offer texts; and the ungodliness
and the vanity and the turning away from the Lord
that Jeremiah lamented were attributed in no unsparing
fashion to the town of Stratford and the inhabitants thereof:
"Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob,
and all the families of the house of Israel: thus saith the
Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that
they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity,
and are become vain?" Nor did he spare himself and his
own calling: "The priests said not, Where is the Lord?
and they that should minister the law knew me not: the
pastors also offended against me, and the prophets prophesied
in Baal, and went after things that did not profit."
And there were bold paraphrases and inductions, too:
"What hast thou now to do in the way of Egypt, to drink
the waters of Nilus? or what makest thou in the way of
Asshur, to drink the waters of the river?" Was not that
the seeking of strange objects&mdash;of baubles, and jewels, and
silks, and other instruments of vanity&mdash;from abroad, from
the papist land of France, to lure the eye and deceive the
senses, and turn away the mind from the dwelling on holy
things? "Can a maid forget her ornament, or the bride
her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without
number." This was, indeed, a fruitful text, and there is no
doubt that Judith was indirectly admonished to regard the
extreme simplicity of her mother's and sister's attire; so
that there can be no excuse whatever for her having in her
mind at this very moment some vague fancy that as soon
as supper was over she would go to her own chamber and
take out a certain beaver hat. She did not often wear it,
for it was a present that her father had once brought her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>from London, and it was ranked among her most precious
treasures; but surely on this evening (she was saying to
herself) it was fitting that she should wear it, not from any
personal vanity, but to the end that this young gentleman,
who seemed to know several of her father's acquaintances
in London, should understand that the daughter of the
owner of New Place was no mere country wench, ignorant
of what was in the fashion. It is grievous that she should
have been concerned with such frivolous thoughts. However,
the chapter came to an end in due time.</p>

<p>Then good Master Blaise said that they would sing the
One-hundred-and-thirty-seventh Psalm; and this was truly
what Judith had been waiting for. She herself was but
an indifferent singer. She could do little more than
hum such snatches of old songs as occurred to her during
her careless rambles, and that only for her private ear;
but her sister Susanna had a most noble, pure, and clear
contralto voice, that could at any time bring tears to Judith's
eyes, and that, when she joined in the choral parts
of the service in church, made many a young man's
heart tremble strangely. In former days she used to sing
to the accompaniment of her lute; but that was given
over now. Once or twice Judith had brought the discarded
instrument to her, and said,</p>

<p>"Susan, sweet Susan, for once, for once only, sing to
me '<i>The rose is from my garden gone</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;to make you cry, silly one?" the elder sister
would answer. "What profit those idle tears, child,
that are but a luxury and a sinful indulgence?"</p>

<p>"Susan, but once!" Judith would plead (with the
tears almost already in her eyes)&mdash;"once only, '<i>The rose
is from my garden gone</i>.' There is none can sing it like
you."</p>

<p>But the elder sister was obdurate, as she considered was
right; and Judith, as she walked through the meadows in
the evening, would sometimes try the song for herself,
thinking, or endeavoring to think, that she could hear in
it the pathetic vibrations of her sister's voice. Indeed, at
this moment the small congregation assembled around the
table would doubtless have been deeply shocked had they
known with what a purely secular delight Judith was now
listening to the words of the psalm. There was but one
Bible in the house, so that Master Blaise read out the first
two lines (lest any of the maids might have a lax memory):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span><span class="i0">"When as we sat in Babylon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rivers round about;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and that they sang; then they proceeded in like manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And in remembrance of Sion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tears for grief burst out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We hanged our harps and instruments<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The willow-trees upon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in that place men for their use<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had planted many a one."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">It is probable, indeed, that Judith was so wrapped up in
her sister's singing that it did not occur to her to ask herself
whether this psalm, too, had not been chosen with
some regard to the good preacher's discontent with those
in power. At all events, he read out, and they sang, no
further than these two verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then they to whom we prisoners were,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said to us tauntingly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let us hear your Hebrew songs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pleasant melody.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! (said we) who can once frame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His sorrowful heart to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The praises of our loving God<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus under a strange king?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But yet if I Jerusalem<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out of my heart let slide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let my fingers quite forget<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The warbling harp to guide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let my tongue within my mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Be tied forever fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that I joy before I see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy full deliverance past."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then there was a short and earnest prayer; and, that
over, the maids set to work to get forward the supper;
and young Willie Hart was called in from the garden&mdash;Judith's
father being away at Wilmcote on some important
business there. In due course of time, supper being
finished, and a devout thanksgiving said, Judith was free;
and instantly she fled away to her own chamber to don
her bravery. It was not vanity (she again said to herself),
it was that her father's daughter should show that she knew
what was due to him and his standing in the town; and
indeed, as she now regarded herself in the little mirror&mdash;she
wore a half-circle farthingale, and had on one of her
smartest ruffs&mdash;and when she set on her head of short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>brown curls this exceedingly pretty hat (it was a gray
beaver above, and underneath it was lined with black
satin, and all around the rim was a row of hollow brass
beads that tinkled like small bells), she was quite well satisfied
with her appearance, and that she was fairly entitled
to be. Then she went down and summoned her sweetheart
Willie, to act as her companion and protector and
ally; and together these two passed forth from the house&mdash;into
the golden clear evening.</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A FAREWELL.</h3>

<p>Always, when she got out into the open air, her spirits
rose into a pure content; and now, as they were walking
westward through the peaceful meadows, the light of the
sunset was on her face; and there was a kind of radiance
there, and careless happiness, that little Willie Hart
scarce dared look upon, so abject and wistful was the worship
that the small lad laid at his pretty cousin's feet.
He was a sensitive and imaginative boy; and the joy and
crown of his life was to be allowed to walk out with his
cousin Judith, her hand holding his; and it did not matter
to him whether she spoke to him, or whether she was
busy with her private thinking, and left him to his own
pleasure and fancies. He had many of these; for he had
heard of all kinds of great and noble persons&mdash;princesses,
and empresses, and queens; but to him his cousin Judith
was the Queen of queens; he could not believe that any one
ever was more beautiful&mdash;or more gentle and lovable, in
a magical and mystical way&mdash;than she was; and in church,
on the quiet Sunday mornings, when the choir was singing,
and all else silence, and dreams were busy in certain small
brains, if there were any far-away pictures of angels in
white and shining robes, coming toward one through rose-red
celestial gardens, be sure they had Judith's eyes and
the light and witchery of these; and that, when they
spoke (if such wonderful creatures vouchsafed to speak),
it was with the softness of Judith's voice. So it is not to
be conceived that Judith, who knew something of this
mute and secret adoration, had any malice in her heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>when, on this particular evening, she began to question
the boy as to the kind of sweetheart he would choose
when he was grown up: the fact being that she spoke
from idleness, and a wish to be friendly and companionable,
her thoughts being really occupied elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Come now, Willie, tell me," said she, "what sort of one
you will choose, some fifteen or twenty years hence, when
you are grown up to be a man, and will be going abroad
from place to place. In Coventry, perchance, you may
find her, or over at Evesham, or in Warwick, or Worcester,
or as far away as Oxford; in all of them are plenty of
pretty maidens to be had for the asking, so you be civil-spoken
enough, and bear yourself well. Now tell me
your fancy, sweetheart; what shall her height be?"</p>

<p>"Why, you know, Judith," said he, rather shamefacedly.
"Just your height."</p>

<p>"My height?" she said, carelessly. "Why, that is
neither the one way nor the other. My father says I am
just as high as his heart; and with that I am content.
Well, now, her hair&mdash;what color of hair shall she have?"</p>

<p>"Like yours, Judith; and it must come round about
her ears like yours," said he, glancing up for a moment.</p>

<p>"Eyes: must they be black, or gray, or brown, or blue?
nay, you shall have your choice, sweetheart Willie; there
be all sorts, if you go far enough afield and look around
you. What eyes do you like, now?"</p>

<p>"You know well, Judith, there is no one has such pretty
eyes as you; these are the ones I like, and no others."</p>

<p>"Bless the boy!&mdash;would you have her to be like me?"</p>

<p>"Just like you, Judith&mdash;altogether," said he, promptly;
and he added, more shyly, "for you know there is none
as pretty, and they all of them say that."</p>

<p>"Marry, now!" said she, with a laugh. "Here be
news. What? When you go choosing your sweetheart,
would you pick out one that had as large hands as
these?"</p>

<p>She held forth her hands, and regarded them; and yet
with some complacency, for she had put on a pair of
scented gloves which her father had brought her from
London, and these were beautifully embroidered with silver,
for he knew her tastes, and that she was not afraid to
wear finery, whatever the preachers might say.</p>

<p>"Why, you know, Judith," said he, "that there is none
has such pretty hands as you, nor so white, nor so soft."</p>

<p>"Heaven save us! am I perfection, then?" she cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>(but she was pleased). "Must she be altogether like
me?"</p>

<p>"Just so, Cousin Judith; altogether like you; and she
must wear pretty things like you, and walk as you walk,
and speak like you, else I shall not love her nor go near
her, though she were the Queen herself."</p>

<p>"Well said, sweetheart Willie!&mdash;you shall to the court
some day, if you can speak so fair. And shall I tell you,
now, how you must woo and win such a one?" she continued,
lightly. "It may be you shall find her here or there&mdash;in
a farm-house, perchance; or she may be a great lady with
her coach; or a wench in an ale-house; but if she be as
you figure her, this is how you shall do: you must not
grow up to be too nice and fine and delicate-handed; you
must not bend too low for her favor; but be her lord and
governor; and you must be ready to fight for her, if need
there be&mdash;yes, you shall not suffer a word to be said in dispraise
of her; and for slanderers you must have a cudgel
and a stout arm withal; and yet you must be gentle with
her, because she is a woman; and yet not too gentle, for
you are a man; and you must be no slape-face, with whining
through the nose that we are all devilish and wicked
and the children of sin; and you must be no tavern-seeker,
with oaths and drunken jests and the like; and when you
find her you must be the master of her&mdash;and yet a gentle
master: marry, I cannot tell you more; but, as I hope
for heaven, sweet Willie, you will do well and fairly if she
loves thee half as much as I do."</p>

<p>And she patted the boy's head. What sudden pang was
it that went through his heart?</p>

<p>"They say you are going to marry Parson Blaise, Judith,"
said he, looking up at her.</p>

<p>"Do they, now?" said she, with a touch of color in her
face. "They are too kind that would take from me the
business of choosing for myself."</p>

<p>"Is it true, Judith?"</p>

<p>"It is but idle talk; heed it not, sweetheart," said she,
rather sharply. "I would they were as busy with their
fingers as with their tongues; there would be more wool
spun in Warwickshire!"</p>

<p>But here she remembered that she had no quarrel with
the lad, who had but innocently repeated the gossip he
had heard; and so she spoke to him in a more gentle fashion;
and, as they were now come to a parting of the ways,
she said that she had a message to deliver, and bade him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>go on by himself to the cottage, and have some flowers
gathered for her from out of the garden by the time she
should arrive. He was a biddable boy, and went on without
further question. Then she turned off to the left, and
in a few minutes was in the wide and wooded lane where
she was to meet the young gentleman that had appealed
to her friendliness.</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, he was; and as he came forward,
hat in hand, to greet her, those eloquent black eyes
of his expressed so much pleasure (and admiration of a
respectful kind) that Judith became for a moment a trifle
self-conscious, and remembered that she was in unusually
brave attire. There may have been something else: some
quick remembrance of the surprise and alarm of the morning;
and also&mdash;in spite of her determination to banish
such unworthy fancies&mdash;some frightened doubt as to
whether, after all, there might not be a subtle connection
between her meeting with this young gentleman and the
forecasts of the wizard. This was but for a moment, but
it confused her in what she had intended to say (for, in
crossing the meadows, she had been planning out certain
speeches as well as talking idly to Willie Hart), and she
was about to make some stumbling confession to the effect
that she had obtained no clear intelligence from her
gossip Prudence Shawe, when the young gentleman himself
absolved her from all further difficulty.</p>

<p>"I beseech your pardon, sweet lady," said he, "that I
have caused you so much trouble, and that to no end; for
I am of a mind now not to carry the letter to your father,
whatever hopes there might be of his sympathy and friendship."</p>

<p>She stared in surprise.</p>

<p>"Nay, but, good sir," said she, "since you have the
letter, and are so near to Stratford, that is so great a distance
from London, surely it were a world of pities you
did not see my father. Not that I can honestly gather
that he would have any favor for a desperate enterprise
upsetting the peace of the land&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am in none such, Mistress Judith, believe me," said
he, quickly. "But it behooves me to be cautious; and I
have heard that within the last few hours which summons
me away. If I were inclined to run the risk, there is no
time at this present: and what I can do now is to try to
thank you for the kindness you have shown to one that
has no habit of forgetting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>"You are going away forthwith?" said she.</p>

<p>There was no particular reason why she should be sorry
at his departure from the neighborhood, except that he
was an extraordinarily gentle-spoken young man, and of a
courteous breeding, whom her father, as she thought,
would have been pleased to welcome as being commended
from his friend Ben Jonson. Few visitors came to
New Place; the faces to be met with there were grown
familiar year after year. It seemed a pity that this stranger&mdash;and
so fair-spoken a stranger, moreover&mdash;should be
close at hand, without making her father's acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Yes, sweet lady," said he, in the same respectful way,
"it is true that I must quit my present lodging for a time;
but I doubt whether I could find anywhere a quieter or
securer place&mdash;nay, I have no reason to fear you; I will
tell you freely that it is Bassfield Farm, that is on the left
before you go down the hill to Bidford; and it is like
enough I may come back thither, when that I see how
matters stand with me in London."</p>

<p>And then he glanced at her with a certain diffidence.</p>

<p>"Perchance I am too daring," said he; "and yet your
courtesy makes me bold. Were I to communicate with
you when I return&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and his hesitation well became him; it was
more eloquent in its modesty than many words.</p>

<p>"That were easily done," said Judith at once, and with
her usual frankness; "but I must tell you, good sir, that
any written message you might send me I should have to
show to my friend and gossip Prudence Shawe, that reads
and writes for me, being so skilled in that; and when
you said that to no one was the knowledge to be given
that you were in this neighborhood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sweet lady," said he, instantly, with much gratitude
visible in those handsome dark eyes, "if I may so far trespass
on your goodness, I would leave that also within your
discretion. One that you have chosen to be your friend
must needs be trustworthy&mdash;nay, I am sure of that."</p>

<p>"But my father too, good sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, not so," said he, with some touch of entreaty in
his voice. "Take it not ill of me, but one that is in peril
must use precautions for his safety, even though they savor
of ill manners and suspicion."</p>

<p>"As you will, sir&mdash;as you will; I know little of such
matters," Judith said. "But yet I know that you do wrong
to mistrust my father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>"Nay, dearest lady," he said, quickly, "it is you that do
me wrong to use such words. I mistrust him not; but,
indeed, I dare not disclose to him the charge that is
brought against me until I have clearer proofs of my innocence,
and these I hope to have in time, when I may present
myself to your father without fear. Meanwhile,
sweet Mistress Judith, I can but ill express my thanks to
you that you have vouchsafed to lighten the tedium of my
hiding through these few words that have passed between
us. Did you know the dulness of the days at the farm&mdash;for
sad thoughts are but sorry companions&mdash;you would
understand my gratitude toward you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, nothing, good sir, nothing," said she; and then
she paused, in some difficulty. She did not like to bid him
farewell without any reference whatsoever to the future;
for in truth she wished to hear more of him, and how his
fortunes prospered. And yet she hesitated about betraying
so much interest&mdash;of however distant and ordinary a
kind&mdash;in the affairs of a stranger. Her usual frank sympathy
conquered: besides, was not this unhappy young
man the friend of her father's friend?</p>

<p>"Is it to the farm that you return when you have been
to London?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I trust so: better security I could not easily find elsewhere;
and my well-wishers have means of communication
with me, so that I can get the news there. Pray
Heaven I may soon be quit of this skulking in corners!
I like it not: it is not the life of a free man."</p>

<p>"I hope your fortunes will mend, sir, and speedily,"
said she, and there was an obvious sincerity in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, with a laugh&mdash;for, indeed, this young
man, to be one in peril of his life, bore himself with a
singularly free and undaunted demeanor; and he was not
looking around him in a furtive manner, as if he feared to
be observed, but was allowing his eyes to rest on Judith's
eyes, and on the details of her costume (which he seemed
to approve), in a quite easy and unconcerned manner&mdash;"the
birds and beasts we hunt are allowed to rest at times,
but a man in hiding has no peace nor freedom from week's
end to week's end&mdash;no, nor at any moment of the day or
night. And if the good people that shelter him are not
entirely of his own station, and if he cares to have but
little speech with them, and if the only book in the house
be the family Bible, then the days are like to pass slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>with him. Can you wonder, sweet Mistress Judith," he
continued, turning his eyes to the ground in a modest
manner, "that I shall carry away the memory of this
meeting with you as a treasure, and dwell on it, and recall
the kindness of each word you have spoken?"</p>

<p>"In truth, no, good sir," she said, with a touch of color
in her cheeks, that caught the warm golden light shining
over from the west. "I would not have you think them of
any importance, except the hope that matters may go well
with you."</p>

<p>"And if they should," said he, "or if they should go ill,
and if I were to presume to think that you cared to know
them, when I return to Bassfield I might make so bold as
to send you some brief tidings, through your friend Mistress
Prudence Shawe, that I am sure must be discreet,
since she has won your confidence. But why should I do
so?" he added, after a second. "Why should I trouble you
with news of one whose good or evil fortune cannot concern
you?"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, I wish you well," said she, simply, "and would
fain hear better tidings of your condition. If you may not
come at present to New Place, where you would have better
counsel than I can give you, at least you may remember
that there is one in the household there that will be glad
when she hears of your welfare, and better pleased still when
she learns that you are free to make her father's friendship."</p>

<p>This was clearly a dismissal; and after a few more words
of gratitude on his part (he seemed almost unable to take
away his eyes from her face, or to say all that he would fain
say of thanks for her gracious intervention and sympathy)
they parted; and forthwith Judith&mdash;now with a much
lighter heart, for this interview had cost her not a little
embarrassment and anxiety&mdash;hastened away back through
the lane in the direction of the barns and gardens of Shottery.
All these occurrences of the day had happened so
rapidly that she had had but little time to reflect over them;
but now she was clearly glad that she should be able to talk
over the whole affair with Prudence Shawe. There would
be comfort in that, and also safety; for, if the truth must
be told, that wild and bewildering fancy that perchance the
wizard had prophesied truly would force itself on her mind
in a disquieting manner. But she strove to reason herself
and laugh herself out of such imaginings. She had plenty
of courage and a strong will. From the first she had made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>light of the wizard's pretensions; she was not going to
alarm herself about the possible future consequences of
this accidental meeting. And, indeed, when she recalled
the particulars of that meeting, she came to think that the
circumstances of the young man could not be so very desperate.
He did not speak nor look like one in imminent
peril; his gay description of the masques and entertainments
of the court was not the talk of a man seriously and
really in danger of his life. Perhaps he had been in some
thoughtless escapade, and was waiting for the bruit of it to
blow over: perhaps he was unused to confinement, and
may have exaggerated (for this also occurred to her) somewhat
in order to win her sympathy. But, anyhow, he was
in some kind of misfortune or trouble, and she was sorry
for him; and she thought that if Prudence Shawe could
see him, and observe how well-bred and civil-spoken and
courteous a young gentleman he seemed to be, she, too,
would pity the dulness of the life he must be leading
at the farm, and be glad to do anything to relieve such a
tedium. In truth, by the time Judith was drawing near her
grandmother's cottage, she had convinced herself that there
was no dark mystery connected with this young man; that
she had not been holding converse with any dangerous villain
or conspirator; and that soon everything would be
cleared up, and perhaps he himself present himself at New
Place, with Ben Jonson's letter in his hand. So she was
in a cheerful enough frame of mind when she arrived at
the cottage.</p>

<p>This was a picturesque little building of brick and timber,
with a substantial roof of thatch, and irregularly placed
small windows; and it was prettily set in front of a wild
and variegated garden, and of course all the golden glow
of the west was now flooding the place with its beautiful
light, and causing the little rectangular panes in the open
casements to gleam like jewels. And here, at the wooden
gate of the garden, was Willie Hart, who seemed to have
been using the time profitably, for he had a most diverse
and sweet-scented gathering of flowers and herbs of a humble
and familiar kind&mdash;forget-me-nots, and pansies, and
wall-flower, and mint, and sweet-brier, and the like&mdash;to
present to his pretty cousin.</p>

<p>"Well done, sweetheart? and are all these for me?"
said she, as she passed within the little gate, and stood for
a moment arranging and regarding them. "What, then,
what is this?&mdash;what mean you by it, Cousin Willie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>"By what, Cousin Judith?" said the small boy, looking
up with his wondering and wistful eyes.</p>

<p>"Why," said she, gayly, "this pansy that you have put
fair in the front. Know you not the name of it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I know it not, Cousin Judith."</p>

<p>"Ah, you cunning one! well you know it, I'll be sworn!
Why, 'tis one of the chiefest favorites everywhere. Did
you never hear it called 'kiss me at the gate?' Marry,
'tis an excellent name; and if I take you at your word, little
sweetheart?"</p>

<p>And so they went into the cottage together; and she had
her arm lying lightly round his neck.</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>A QUARREL.</h3>

<p>But instantly her manner changed. Just within the
doorway of the passage that cut the rambling cottage into
two halves, and attached to a string that was tied to the
handle of the door, lay a small spaniel-gentle, peacefully
snoozing; and well Judith knew that the owner of the dog
(which she had heard, indeed, was meant to be presented
to herself) was inside. However, there was no retreat possible,
if retreat she would have preferred; for here was the
aged grandmother&mdash;a little old woman, with fresh pink
cheeks, silver-white hair, and keen eyes&mdash;come out to see
if it were Judith's footsteps she had heard; and she was
kindly in her welcome of the girl, though usually she grumbled
a good deal about her, and would maintain that it was
pure pride and wilfulness that kept her from getting married.</p>

<p>"Here be finery!" said she, stepping back as if to gain
a fairer view. "God's mercy, wench, have you come to
your senses at last?&mdash;be you seeking a husband?&mdash;would
you win one of them? They have waited a goodly time for
the bating of your pride; but you must after them at last&mdash;ay,
ay, I thought 'twould come to that."</p>

<p>"Good grandmother, you give me no friendly welcome,"
said Judith. "And Willie here; have you no word for
him, that he is come to see how you do?"</p>

<p>"Nay, come in, then, sweetings both; come in and sit ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>down: little Willie has been in the garden long enough,
though you know I grudge you not the flowers, wench.
Ay, ay, there is one within, Judith, that would fain be a
nearer neighbor, as I hear, if you would but say yea; and
bethink ye, wench, an apple may hang too long on the
bough&mdash;your bravery may be put on to catch the eye when
it is overlate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray you, good grandmother, forbear," said Judith,
with some asperity. "I have my own mind about such
things."</p>

<p>"All's well, wench, all's well," said the old dame, as she
led the way into the main room of the cottage. It was a
wide and spacious apartment, with heavy black beams overhead,
a mighty fire-place, here or there a window in the
walls just as it seemed to have been wanted, and in the
middle of the floor a plain old table, on which were placed
a jug and two or three horn tumblers.</p>

<p>Of course Judith knew whom she had to expect: the
presence of the little spaniel-gentle at the door had told
her that. This young fellow that now quickly rose from
his chair and came forward to meet her&mdash;"Good-even to
you, Judith," said he, in a humble way, and his eyes seemed
to beseech her favor&mdash;was as yet but in his two-and-twentieth
year, but his tall and lithe and muscular figure had
already the firm set of manhood on it. He was spare of
form and square-shouldered; his head smallish, his brown
hair short; his features were regular, and the forehead, if
not high, was square and firm; the general look of him was
suggestive of a sculptured Greek or Roman wrestler, but
that this deprecating glance of the eyes was not quite consistent.
And, to tell the truth, wrestling and his firm-sinewed
figure had something to do with his extreme humility
on this occasion. He was afraid that Judith had heard
something. To have broken the head of a tapster was not
a noble performance, no matter how the quarrel was forced
on him; and this was but the most recent of several squabbles;
for the championship in the athletic sports of a country
neighborhood is productive of rivals, who may take
many ways of provoking anger. "Good-even to you, Judith,"
said he, as if he really would have said, "Pray you believe
not all the ill you hear of me!" Judith, however, did
not betray anything by her manner, which was friendly
enough in a kind of formal way, and distinctly reserved.
She sat down, and asked her grandmother what news she
had of the various members of the family, that now were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>widely scattered throughout Warwickshire. She declined
the cup of merry-go-down that the young man civilly offered
to her. She had a store of things to tell about her
father; and about the presents he had brought; and about
the two pieces of song-music that Master Robert Johnson
had sent, that her father would have Susan try over on the
lute; and the other twenty acres that were to be added;
and the talk there had been of turning the house opposite
New Place, at the corner of Chapel Street and Scholars
Lane, into a tavern, and how that had happily been abandoned&mdash;for
her father wanted no tavern-revelry within hearing;
and so forth; but all this was addressed to the grandmother.
The young man got scarce a word, though now
and again he would interpose gently, and, as it were, begging
her to look his way. She was far kinder to Willie
Hart, who was standing by her side; for sometimes she
would put her hand on his shoulder, or stroke his long
yellow-brown hair.</p>

<p>"Willie says he will have just such another as I, grandmother,"
said she, when these topics were exhausted, "to
be his sweetheart when he grows up; so you see there be
some that value me."</p>

<p>"Look to it that you be not yourself unmarried then,
Judith," said the old dame, who was never done grumbling
on this account. "I should not marvel; they that refuse
when they are sought come in time to wonder that there
are none to seek&mdash;nay, 'tis so, I warrant you. You are
hanging late on the bough, wench; see you be not forgotten."</p>

<p>"But, good grandmother," said Judith, with some color
in her cheeks (for this was an awkward topic in the presence
of this youth), "would you have me break from the
rule of the family? My mother was six-and-twenty when
she married, and Susan four-and-twenty; and indeed there
might come one of us who did not perceive the necessity
of marrying at all."</p>

<p>"In God's name, if that be your mind, wench, hold to it.
Hold to it, I say!" And then the old dame glanced
with her sharp eyes at the pretty costume of her visitor.
"But I had other thoughts when I saw such a fine young
madam at the door; in truth, they befit you well, these
braveries; indeed they do; though 'tis a pity to have them
bedecking out one that is above the marrying trade. But
take heed, wench, take heed lest you change your mind
when it is too late; the young men may hold you to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>word, and you find yourself forsaken when you least expect
it."</p>

<p>"Give ye thanks for your good comfort, grandmother,"
said Judith, indifferently. And then she rose. "Come,
Willie, 'tis about time we were going through the fields to
the town. What message have you, grandmother, for my
father? He is busy from morning till night since his coming
home; but I know he will be over to visit you soon.
The flowers, Willie&mdash;did you leave them on the bench outside?"</p>

<p>But she was not allowed to depart in this fashion. The
old dame's discontents with her pretty granddaughter&mdash;that
was now grown into so fair and blithe a young woman&mdash;were
never of a lasting nature; and now she would have both
Judith and little Willie taste of some gingerbread of her
own baking, and then Judith had again to refuse a sup of
the ale that stood on the table, preferring a little water instead.
Moreover, when they had got out into the garden,
behold! this young man would come also, to convoy them
home on their way across the fields. It was a gracious
evening, sweet and cool; there was a clear twilight shining
over the land; the elms were dark against the palely
luminous sky. And then, as the three of them went across
the meadows toward Stratford town, little Willie Hart was
intrusted with the care of the spaniel-gentle&mdash;that was
young and wayward, and possessed with a mad purpose of
hunting sparrows&mdash;and as the dog kept him running this
way and that, he was mostly at some distance from these
other two, and Judith's companion, young Quiney, had
every opportunity of speaking with her.</p>

<p>"I sent you a message, Judith," said he, rather timidly,
but anxiously watching the expression of her face all the
time, "a token of remembrance: I trust it did not displease
you?"</p>

<p>"You should have considered through whose hands it
would come," said she, without regarding him.</p>

<p>"How so?" he asked, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, you know that Prudence would have to read it."</p>

<p>"And why not, Judith? Why should she not? She is
your friend; and I care not who is made aware that&mdash;that&mdash;well,
you know what I mean, dear Judith, but, I fear to
anger you by saying it. You were not always so hard to
please."</p>

<p>There was a touch of reproach in this that she did not
like. Besides, was it fair? Of course she had been kinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>to him when he was a mere stripling&mdash;when they were boy
and girl together; but now he had put forth other pretensions;
and they stood on a quite different footing; and in
his pertinacity he would not understand why she was always
speaking to him of Prudence Shawe, and extolling
her gentleness and sweet calm wisdom and goodness. "The
idle boy!" she would say to herself; "Why did God give
him such a foolish head that he must needs come fancying
me?" And sometimes she was angry because of his dulness
and that he would not see; though, indeed, she could
not speak quite plainly.</p>

<p>"You should think," said she, on this occasion, with some
sharpness, "that these idle verses that you send me are
read by Prudence. Well, doubtless, she may not heed
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why should she heed, Judith?" said he. "'Tis but an
innocent part she takes in the matter&mdash;a kindness, merely."</p>

<p>She dared not say more, and she was vexed with him for
putting this restraint upon her. She turned upon him with
a glance of sudden and rather unfriendly scrutiny.</p>

<p>"What is this now that I hear of you?" said she. "Another
brawl! A tavern brawl! I marvel you have escaped
so long with a whole skin."</p>

<p>"I know not who carries tales of me to you, Judith,"
said he, somewhat warmly, "but if you yourself were more
friendly you would take care to choose a more friendly
messenger. It is always the worst that you hear. If there
was a brawl, it was none of my seeking. And if my skin is
whole, I thank God I can look after that for myself; I am
not one that will be smitten on one cheek and turn the
other&mdash;like your parson friend."</p>

<p>This did not mend matters much.</p>

<p>"My parson friend?" said she, with some swift color in
her cheeks. "My parson friend is one that has respect
for his office, and has a care for his reputation, and lives a
peaceable, holy life. Would you have him frequent ale-houses,
and fight with drawers and tapsters? Marry and
amen! but I find no fault with the parson's life."</p>

<p>"Nay, that is true, indeed," said he, bitterly: "you can
find no fault in the parson&mdash;as every one says. But there
are others that see with other eyes, and would tell you in
what he might amend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I care not to know," said she.</p>

<p>"It were not amiss," said he, for he was determined to
speak&mdash;"it were not amiss if Sir Parson showed a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>more honesty in his daily walk&mdash;that were not amiss, for
one thing."</p>

<p>"In what is he dishonest, then?" said she, instantly, and
she turned and faced him with indignant eyes.</p>

<p>Well, he did not quail. His blood was up. This championship
of the parson, that he had scarce expected of her,
only fired anew certain secret suspicions of his; and he had
no mind to spare his rival, whether he were absent or no.</p>

<p>"Why, then, does he miscall the King, and eat the King's
bread?" said he, somewhat hotly. "Is it honest to conform
in public, and revile in private? I say, let him go forth,
as others have been driven forth, if the state of affairs content
him not. I say that they who speak against the King&mdash;marry,
it were well done to chop the rogues' ears off!&mdash;I
say they should be ashamed to eat the King's bread."</p>

<p>"He eats no King's bread?" said Judith.&mdash;and alas! her
eyes had a look in them that pierced him to the heart: it
was not the glance he would fain have met with there.
"He eats the bread of the Church, that has been despoiled
of its possessions again and again by the Crown and the
lords; and why should he go forth? He is a minister; is
there harm that he should wish to see the services reformed?
He is at his post; would you have him desert it, or else
keep silent? No, he is no such coward, I warrant you. He
will speak his mind; it were ill done of him else?"</p>

<p>"Nay, he can do no harm at all&mdash;in your judgment,"
said he, somewhat sullenly, "if it all be true that they say."</p>

<p>"And who is it, then, that should speak of idle tales
and the believing of them?" said she, with indignant reproach.
"You say I welcome evil stories about you?
And you? Are you so quick to put away the idle gossip
they bring you about me? Would you not rather believe
it? I trow you would as lief believe it as not. That it is
to have friends! That it is to have those who should defend
you in your absence; but would rather listen to
slander against you! But when they speak about women's
idle tongues, they know little; it is men who are the
readiest to listen, and to carry evil reports and lying!"</p>

<p>"I meant not to anger you, Judith," said he, more
humbly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have angered me," said she (with her lips
becoming tremulous, but only for a second). "What concern
have I with Parson Blaise? I would they that spake
against him were as good men and honest as he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed, they speak no ill of him, Judith," said he (for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>he was grieved that they were fallen out so, and there was
nothing he would not have retracted that so he might win
back to her favor again, in however small a degree), "except
that he is disputatious, and would lead matters no
one knows whither. 'Tis but a few minutes ago that your
grandmother there was saying that we should never have
peace and quiet in Church affairs till the old faith was restored&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here, indeed, she pricked up her ears; but she would
say no more. She had not forgiven him yet; and she was
proud and silent.</p>

<p>"And though I do not hold with that&mdash;for there would
be a bloody struggle before the Pope could be master in
England again&mdash;nevertheless, I would have the ministers
men of peace, as they profess to be, and loyal to the King,
who is at the head of the Church as well as of the realm.
However, let it pass. I wish to have no quarrel with you,
Judith."</p>

<p>"How does your business?" said she, abruptly changing
the subject.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;excellently well; it is not in that direction that
I have any anxiety about the future."</p>

<p>"Do you give it your time? You were best take heed,
for else it is like to slip away from you," she said; and he
thought she spoke rather coldly, and as if her warning
were meant to convey something more than appeared.</p>

<p>And then she added:</p>

<p>"You were at Wilmecote on Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"You must have heard why, Judith," he said. "Old
Pike was married again that day, and they would have me
over to his wedding."</p>

<p>"And on the Wednesday, what was there at Bidford,
then, that you must needs be gone when my mother sent
to you?"</p>

<p>"At Bidford?" said he (and he was sorely puzzled as to
whether he should rejoice at these questions as betraying
a friendly interest in his affairs, or rather regarded them
as conveying covert reproof, and expressing her dissatisfaction
with him, and distrust of him). "At Bidford, Judith&mdash;well,
there was business as well as pleasure there.
For you must know that Daniel Hutt is come home for a
space from the new settlements in Virginia, and is for
taking back with him a number of laborers that are all in
due time to make their fortunes there. Marry, 'tis a good
chance for some of them, for broken men are as welcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>as any, and there are no questions asked as to their having
been intimate with the constable and the justice. So there
was a kind of merry-meeting of Daniel's old friends, that
was held at the Falcon at Bidford&mdash;and the host is a good
customer of mine, so it was prudent of me to go thither&mdash;and
right pleasant was it to hear Daniel Hutt tell of his
adventures by sea and shore. And he gave us some of the
tobacco that he had brought with him. And to any that
will go back with him to Jamestown he promises allotments
of land, though at first there will be tough labor, as
he says, honestly. Oh, a worthy man is this Daniel Hutt,
though, as yet his own fortune seems not so secure."</p>

<p>"With such junketings," said she, with ever so slight a
touch of coldness, "'tis no wonder you could not spare
the time to come and see my father on the evening of his
getting home."</p>

<p>"There, now, Judith!" he exclaimed. "Would you
have me break in upon him at such a busy season, when
even you yourself are careful to refrain? It had been ill-mannered
of me to do such a thing; but 'twas no heedlessness
that led to my keeping away, as you may well imagine."</p>

<p>"It is difficult to know the reasons when friends hold
aloof," said she. "You have not been near the house for
two or three weeks, as I reckon."</p>

<p>And here again he would have given much to know
whether her speech&mdash;which was curiously reserved in tone&mdash;meant
that she had marked these things out of regard
for him, or that she wished to reprove him.</p>

<p>"I can give you the reason for that, Judith," said this
tall and straight young fellow, who from time to time regarded
his companion's face with some solicitude, as if he
fain would have found some greater measure of friendliness
there. "I have not been often to New Place of late
because of one I thought I might meet there who would
be no better pleased to see me than I him; and&mdash;and perhaps
because of another&mdash;that I did not know whether she
might be the better pleased to have me there or find me
stay away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your reasons are too fine," said she. "I scarce understand
them."</p>

<p>"That is because you won't understand; I think I have
spoken plain enough ere now, Judith, I make bold to
say."</p>

<p>She flushed somewhat at this; but it was no longer in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>anger. She seemed willing to be on good terms with him,
but always in that measured and distant way.</p>

<p>"Willie!" she called. "Come hither, sweetheart!"</p>

<p>With some difficulty her small cousin made his way back
to her, dragging the reluctant spaniel so that its head
seemed to be in jeopardy.</p>

<p>"He <i>will</i> go after the birds, Cousin Judith; you will
never teach him to follow you."</p>

<p>"I?" she said.</p>

<p>"Willie knows I want you to have the dog, Judith," her
companion said, quickly. "I got him for you when I was
at Gloucester. 'Tis a good breed&mdash;true Maltese, I can
warrant him; and the fashionable ladies will scarce stir
abroad without one to follow them, or to carry with them
in their coaches when they ride. Will you take him Judith?"</p>

<p>She was a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>"'Tis a pretty present," said she, "but you have not
chosen the right one to give it to."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" said he.</p>

<p>"Nay, now, have not I the Don?" she said, with greater
courage. "He is a sufficient companion if I wish to walk
abroad. Why should you not give this little spaniel to
one that has no such companion&mdash;I mean to Prudence
Shaw?"</p>

<p>"To Prudence!" said he, regarding her; for this
second introduction of Judith's friend seemed strange, as
well as the notion that he should transfer this prized gift
to her.</p>

<p>"There, now, is one so gentle and kind to every one
and everything that she would tend the little creature with
care," she continued. "It would be more fitting for her
than for me."</p>

<p>"You could be kind enough, Judith&mdash;if you chose,"
said he, under his breath, for Willie Hart was standing
by.</p>

<p>"Nay, I have the Don," said she, "that is large, and
worldly, and serious, and clumsy withal. Give this little
playfellow to Prudence, who is small and neat and gentle
like itself; surely that were fitter."</p>

<p>"I had hoped you would have accepted the little spaniel
from me, Judith," said he, with very obvious disappointment.</p>

<p>"Moreover," said she, lightly, "two of a trade would
never agree: we should have this one and the Don continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>quarrelling, and sooner or later the small one
would lose its head in the Don's great jaws."</p>

<p>"Why, the mastiff is always chained, and at the barn
gate, Judith," said he. "This one would be within-doors,
as your playfellow. But I care not to press a gift."</p>

<p>"Nay, now, be not displeased," said she, gently enough.
"I am not unthankful; I think well of your kindness,
but it were still better done if you were to change your
intention and give the spaniel to one that would have a
gentler charge over it, and think none the less of it, as I
can vouch for. Pray you give it to Prudence."</p>

<p>"A discarded gift is not worth the passing on," said he;
and as they were now come quite near to the town, where
there was a dividing of ways, he stopped as though he
would shake hands and depart.</p>

<p>"Will you not go on to the house? You have not seen
my father since his coming home," she said.</p>

<p>"No, not to-night, Judith," he said. "Doubtless he is
still busy, and I have affairs elsewhere."</p>

<p>She glanced at him with one of those swift keen glances
of hers.</p>

<p>"Where go you to spend the evening, if I may make so
bold?" she said.</p>

<p>"Not to the ale-house, as you seem to suspect," he answered,
with just a trifle of bitterness; and then he took
the string to lead away the spaniel, and he bade her farewell&mdash;in
a kind of half-hearted and disappointed and
downcast way&mdash;and left.</p>

<p>She looked after him a second or so, as she fastened a
glove-button that had got loose. And then she sighed as
she turned away.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart Willie," said she, putting her hand softly
on the boy's shoulder, as he walked beside her, "I think
you said you loved me?"</p>

<p>"Why, you know I do, Cousin Judith," said he.</p>

<p>"What a pity it is, then," said she, absently, "that you
cannot remain always as you are, and keep your ten years
forever and a day, so that we should always be friends as
we are now!"</p>

<p>He did not quite know what she meant, but he was
sufficiently well pleased and contented when he was thus
close by her side; and when her hand was on his shoulder
or on his neck it was to him no burden, but a delight.
And so walking together, and with some gay and careless
prattle between them, they went on and into the town.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></h2>

<h3>THROUGH THE MEADOWS.</h3>

<p>Some two or three days after that, and toward the evening,
Prudence Shawe was in the church-yard, and she was
alone, save that now and again some one might pass along
the gravelled pathway, and these did not stay to interrupt
her. She had with her a basket, partly filled with flowers,
also a small rake and a pair of gardener's shears, and she
was engaged in going from grave to grave, here putting a
few fresh blossoms to replace the withered ones, and there
removing weeds, or cutting the grass smooth, and generally
tending those last resting-places with a patient and
loving care. It was a favorite employment with her when
she had a spare afternoon; nor did she limit her attention
to the graves of those whom she had known in life; her
charge was a general one, and when they who had friends
or relatives buried there came to the church on a Sunday
morning, and perhaps from some distance, and when they
saw that some gentle hand had been employed there in
the interval, they knew right well that that hand was the
hand of Prudence Shawe. It was a strange fancy on the
part of one who was so averse from all ornament or decoration
in ordinary life that nothing was too beautiful for a
grave. She herself would not wear a flower, but her best,
and the best she could beg or borrow anywhere, she freely
gave to those that were gone away; she seemed to have
some vague imagination that our poor human nature was
not worthy of this beautifying care until it had become
sanctified by the sad mystery of death.</p>

<p>It was a calm, golden-white evening, peaceful and silent;
the rooks were cawing in the dark elms above her; the
swallows dipping and darting under the boughs; the
smooth-flowing yellow river was like glass, save that now
and again the perfect surface was broken by the rising of
a fish. Over there in the wide meadows beyond the
stream a number of boys were playing at rounders or
prisoner's-base, or some such noisy game; but the sound
of their shouting was softened by the distance; so quiet
was it here, as she continued at her pious task, that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>might almost have heard herself breathing. And once or
twice she looked up, and glanced toward the little gate as
if expecting some one.</p>

<p>It was Judith, of course, that she was expecting; and at
this moment Judith was coming along to the church-yard
to seek her out. What a contrast there was between these
two&mdash;this one pale and gentle and sad-eyed, stooping over
the mute graves in the shadow of the elms; that other
coming along through the warm evening light with all
her usual audacity of gait, the peach-bloom of health on
her cheek, carelessness and content in her clear-shining
eyes, and the tune of "Green Sleeves" ringing through a
perfectly idle brain. Indeed, what part of her brain may
not have been perfectly idle was bent solely on mischief.
Prudence had been away for two or three days, staying
with an ailing sister. All that story of the adventure with
the unfortunate young gentleman had still to be related to
her. And again and again Judith had pictured to herself
Prudence's alarm and the look of her timid eyes when she
should hear of such doings, and had resolved that the tale
would lose nothing in the telling. Here, indeed, was
something for two country maidens to talk about. The
even current of their lives was broken but by few surprises,
but here was something more than surprise&mdash;something
with suggestions of mystery and even danger behind it.
This was no mere going out to meet a wizard. Any farm
wench might have an experience of that kind; any ploughboy,
deluded by the hope of digging up silver in one of
his master's fields. But a gentleman in hiding&mdash;one that
had been at court&mdash;one that had seen the King sitting in
his chair of state, while Ben Jonson's masque was opened
out before the great and noble assemblage&mdash;this was one
to speak about, truly, one whose fortunes and circumstances
were like to prove a matter of endless speculation and
curiosity.</p>

<p>But when Judith drew near to the little gate of the
church-yard, and saw how Prudence was occupied, her
heart smote her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Green sleeves was all my joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green sleeves was my delight,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">went clear out of her head. There was a kind of shame on
her face; and when she went along to her friend she could
not help exclaiming, "How good you are, Prue!"</p>

<p>"I!" said the other, with some touch of wonder in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>upturned face. "I fear that cannot be said of any of us,
Judith."</p>

<p>"I would I were like you, sweetheart," was the answer,
with a bit of a sigh.</p>

<p>"Like me, Judith?" said Prudence, returning to her
task (which was nearly ended now, for she had but few
more flowers left). "Nay, what makes you think that?
I wish I were far other than I am."</p>

<p>"Look, now," Judith said, "how you are occupied at
this moment. Is there another in Stratford that has such
a general kindness? How many would think of employing
their time so? How many would come away from
their own affairs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It may be I have more idle time than many," said Prudence,
with a slight flush. "But I commend not myself
for this work; in truth, no; 'tis but a pastime; 'tis for my
own pleasure."</p>

<p>"Indeed, then, good Prue, you are mistaken, and that I
know well," said the other, peremptorily. "Your own
pleasure? Is it no pleasure, then, think you, for them
that come from time to time, and are right glad to see that
some one has been tending the graves of their friends or
kinsmen? And do you think, now, it is no pleasure to
the poor people themselves&mdash;I mean them that are gone&mdash;to
look at you as you are engaged so, and to think that
they are not quite forgotten? Surely it must be a pleasure
to them. Surely they cannot have lost all their interest
in what happens here&mdash;in Stratford&mdash;where they lived;
and surely they must be grateful to you for thinking of
them, and doing them this kindness? I say it were ill done
of them else. I say they ought to be thankful to you.
And no doubt they are, could we but learn."</p>

<p>"Judith! Judith! you have such a bold way of regarding
what is all a mystery to us," said her gentle-eyed friend.
"Sometimes you frighten me."</p>

<p>"I would I knew, now," said the other, looking absently
across the river to the boys that were playing there,
"whether my little brother Hamnet&mdash;had you known him
you would have loved him as I did, Prudence&mdash;I say I
wish I knew whether he is quite happy and content where
he is, or whether he would not rather be over there now
with the other boys. If he looks down and sees them, may
it not make him sad sometimes&mdash;to be so far away from
us? I always think of him as being alone there, and he
was never alone here. I suppose he thinks of us sometimes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>Whenever I hear the boys shouting like that at
their play I think of him; but indeed he was never noisy
and unruly. My father used to call him the girl-boy,
but he was fonder of him than of all us others; he once
came all the way from London when he heard that Hamnet
was lying sick of a fever."</p>

<p>She turned to see how Prudence was getting on with
her work; but she was in no hurry; and Prudence was
patient and scrupulously careful; and the dead, had they
been able to speak, would not have bade her cease and go
away, for a gentler hand never touched a grave.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is Grandmother Hathaway who will go
next," Judith continued, in the same absent kind of way;
"but indeed she says she is right well content either to go
or to stay; for now, as she says, she has about as many
kinsfolk there as here, and she will not be going among
strangers. And well I know she will make for Hamnet as
soon as she is there, for like my father's love for Bess Hall
was her love for the boy while he was with us. Tell me,
Prudence, has he grown up to be of my age? You know
we were twins. Is he a man now, so that we should see
him as some one different? Or is he still our little Hamnet,
just as we used to know him?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell you, Judith?" the other said, almost
in pain. "You ask such bold questions; and all these
things are hidden from us and behind a veil."</p>

<p>"But these are what one would like to know," said
Judith, with a sigh. "Nay, if you could but tell me of
such things, then you might persuade me to have a greater
regard for the preachers; but when you come and ask
about such real things, they say it is all a mystery; they
cannot tell; and would have you be anxious about schemes
of doctrine, which are but strings of words. My father,
too: when I go to him&mdash;nay, but it is many a day since I
tried&mdash;he would look at me and say, 'What is in your brain
now? To your needle, wench, to your needle!'"</p>

<p>"But naturally, Judith! Such things are mercifully
hidden from us now, but they will be revealed when it is
fitting for us to know them. How could our ordinary life
be possible if we knew what was going on in the other
world? We should have no interest in the things around
us, the greater interest would be so great."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," said Judith, coming with more practical
eyes to the present moment, "are you finished, sweet
mouse, and will you come away? What, not satisfied yet?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>I wonder if they know the care you take. I wonder if one
will say to the other: 'Come and see. She is there again.
We are not quite forgotten.' And will you do that for me,
too, sweet Prue? Will you put some pansies on my grave,
too?&mdash;and I know you will say out of your charity, 'Well,
she was not good and pious, as I would have had her to
be; she had plenty of faults; but at least she often wished
to be better than she was.' Nay, I forgot," she added,
glancing carelessly over to the church; "they say we shall
lie among the great people, since my father bought the
tithes&mdash;that we have the right to be buried in the chancel;
but indeed I know I would a hundred times liefer have
my grave in the open here, among the grass and the
trees."</p>

<p>"You are too young to have such thoughts as these,
Judith," said her companion, as she rose and shut down
the lid of the now empty basket. "Come; shall we
go?"</p>

<p>"Let us cross the foot-bridge, sweet Prue," Judith said,
"and go through the meadows and round by Clopton's
bridge, and so home; for I have that to tell you will take
some time; pray Heaven it startle you not out of your
senses withal!"</p>

<p>It was not, however, until they had got away from the
church-yard, and were out in the clear golden light of the
open, that she began to tell her story. She had linked
her arm within that of her friend. Her manner was grave;
and if there was any mischief in her eyes, it was of a demure
kind, not easily detected. She confessed that it was
out of mere wanton folly that she had gone to the spot
indicated by the wizard, and without any very definite
hope or belief. But as chance would have it, she did
encounter a stranger&mdash;one, indeed, that was coming to her
father's house. Then followed a complete and minute
narrative of what the young man had said&mdash;the glimpses
he had given her of his present condition, both on the occasion
of that meeting and on the subsequent one, and
how she had obtained his permission to state these things
to this gentle gossip of hers. Prudence listened in silence,
her eyes cast down; Judith could not see the gathering
concern on her face. Nay, the latter spoke rather in a
tone of raillery; for, having had time to look back over
the young gentleman's confessions, and his manner, and
so forth, she had arrived at a kind of assurance that he
was in no such desperate case. There were many reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>why a young man might wish to lie perdu for a time; but
this one had not talked as if any very imminent danger
threatened him; at least, if he had intimated as much, the
impression produced upon her was not permanent. And
if Judith now told the story with a sort of careless bravado&mdash;as
if going forth in secret to meet this stranger was a
thing of risk and hazard&mdash;it was with no private conviction
that there was any particular peril in the matter, but
rather with the vague fancy that the adventure looked daring
and romantic, and would appear as something terrible
in the eyes of her timid friend.</p>

<p>But what now happened startled her. They were going
up the steps of the foot-bridge, Prudence first, and Judith,
following her, had just got to the end of her story. Prudence
suddenly turned round, and her face, now opposed
to the westering light, was, as Judith instantly saw, quite
aghast.</p>

<p>"But, Judith, you do not seem to understand!" she exclaimed.
"Was not that the very stranger the wizard said
you would meet?&mdash;the very hour, the very place? In
good truth, it must have been so! Judith, what manner
of man have you been in company with?"</p>

<p>For an instant a flush of color overspread Judith's face,
and she said, with a sort of embarrassed laugh:</p>

<p>"Well, and if it were so, sweet mouse? If that were
the appointed one, what then?"</p>

<p>She was on the bridge now. Prudence caught her by
both hands, and there was an anxious and piteous appeal
in the loving eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear Judith, I beseech you, be warned! Have nothing
to do with the man! Did I not say that mischief
would come of planting the charm in the church-yard, and
shaming a sacred place with such heathenish magic?
And now look already&mdash;here is one that you dare not speak
of to your own people; he is in secret correspondence
with you. Heaven alone knows what dark deeds he may
be bent upon, or what ruin he may bring upon you and
yours. Judith, you are light-hearted and daring, and you
love to be venturesome; but I know you better than you
know yourself, sweetheart. You would not willingly do
wrong, or bring harm on those that love you; and for the
sake of all of us, Judith, have nothing to do with this man."</p>

<p>Judith was embarrassed, and perhaps a trifle remorseful;
she had not expected her friend to take this adventure
so very seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>"Dear Prue, you alarm yourself without reason," she
said (but there was still some tell-tale color in her face).
"Indeed, there is no magic or witchery about the young
man. Had I seen a ghost, I should have been frightened,
no doubt, for all that Don Roderigo was with me; and
had I met one of the Stratford youths at the appointed
place, I should have said that perhaps the good wizard
had guessed well; but this was merely a stranger coming
to see my father; and the chance that brought us together&mdash;well,
what magic was in that?&mdash;it would have happened
to you had you been walking in the lane: do you see that,
dear mouse?&mdash;it would have happened to yourself had you
been walking in the lane, and he would have asked of you
the question that he asked of me. Nay, banish that fancy,
sweet Prue, else I should be ashamed to do anything further
for the young man that is unfortunate, and very grateful
withal for a few words of friendliness. And so fairly
spoken a young man, too; and so courtly in his bearing;
and of such a handsome presence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, dear Judith, listen to me!&mdash;do not be led into
such peril! Know you not that evil spirits can assume
goodly shapes&mdash;the Prince of Darkness himself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not finish what she had to say, her imagination
was so filled with terror.</p>

<p>"Sweet Puritan," said Judith, with a smile, "I know
well that he goeth about like a raging lion, seeking whom
he may devour; I know it well; but believe me it would
not be worth his travail to haunt such a lonely and useless
place as the lane that goes from Shottery to the Bidford
road. Nay, but I will convince you, good mouse, by the
best of all evidence, that there is nothing ghostly or evil
about the young man; you shall see him, Prue&mdash;indeed
you must and shall. When that he comes back to his hiding,
I will contrive that you shall see him and have speech
with him, and sure you will pity him as much as I do.
Poor young gentleman, that he should be suspected of
being Satan! Nay, how could he be Satan, Prue, and be
admitted to the King's court? Hath not our good King
a powerful insight into the doings of witches and wizards
and the like? and think you he would allow Satan in
person to come into the very Banqueting-hall to see a
masque?"</p>

<p>"Judith! Judith!" said the other, piteously, "when
you strive against me with your wit, I cannot answer you;
but my heart tells me that you are in exceeding danger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>I would warn you, dear cousin; I were no true friend to
you else."</p>

<p>"But you are the best and truest of friends, you dearest
Prue," said Judith, lightly, as she released her hands from
her companion's earnest grasp. "Come, let us on, or we
shall go supperless for the evening."</p>

<p>She passed along and over the narrow bridge, and down
the steps on the other side. She did <span class="err" title="original: not not">not</span> seem much
impressed by Prudence's entreaties; indeed, she was singing
aloud:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hey, good fellow, I drink to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pardonnez moi, je vous en prie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all good fellows, where'er they be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a penny of money!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Prudence overtook her.</p>

<p>"Judith," said she, "even if he be not of that fearful
kind&mdash;even if he be a real man, and such as he represents
himself, bethink you what you are doing! There may be
another such gathering as that at Dunchurch; and would
you be in correspondence with a plotter and murderer?
Nay, what was't you asked of me the other day?" she
added, suddenly; and she stood still to confront her
friend, with a new alarm in her eyes. "Did you not ask
whether your father was well affected toward the Papists?
Is there another plot?&mdash;another treason against the King?&mdash;and
you would harbor one connected with such a
wicked, godless, and bloodthirsty plan?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, sweet mouse! Have I not told you? He
declares he has naught to do with any such enterprise;
and if you would but see him, Prudence, you would believe
him. Sure I am that you would believe him instantly.
Why, now, there be many reasons why a young gentleman
might wish to remain concealed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None, Judith, none!" the other said, with decision.
"Why should an honest man fear the daylight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," was the careless answer, "there be
many an honest man that has got into the clutches of the
twelve-in-the-hundred rogues; and when the writs are out
against such a one, I hold it no shame that he would
rather be out of the way than be thrown among the
wretches in Bocardo. I know well what I speak of;
many a time have I heard my father and your brother
talk of it; how the rogues of usurers will keep a man in
prison for twelve years for a matter of sixteen shillings&mdash;what
is it they call it?&mdash;making dice of his bones? And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>if the young gentleman fear such treatment and the horrible
company of the prisons, I marvel not that he should
prefer the fresh air of Bidford, howsoever dull the life at
the farm may be."</p>

<p>"And if that were all, why should he fear to bring the
letter to your father?" the other said, with a quick glance
of suspicion: she did not like the way in which Judith's
ready brain could furnish forth such plausible conjectures
and excuses. "Answer me that, Judith. Is your father
one likely to call aloud and have the man taken, if that be
all that is against him? Why should he be afraid to
bring the letter from your father's friend? Nay, why
should he be on the way to the house with it, and thereafter
stop short and change his mind? There is many a
mile betwixt London and Stratford; 'tis a marvellous
thing he should travel all that way, and change his mind
within a few minutes of being in the town. I love not
such dark ways, Judith; no good thing can come of them,
but evil; and it were ill done of you&mdash;even if you be careless
of danger to yourself, as I trow you mostly are&mdash;I say
it is ill done of you to risk the peace of your family by
holding such dangerous converse with a stranger, and one
that may bring harm to us all."</p>

<p>Judith was not well pleased; her mouth became rather
proud.</p>

<p>"Marry, if this be your Christian charity, I would not
give a penny ballad for it!" said she, with some bitterness
of tone. "I had thought the story had another teaching&mdash;I
mean the story of him who fell among thieves and was
beaten and robbed and left for dead&mdash;and that we were to
give a helping hand to such, like the Samaritan. But
now I mind me 'twas the Priest that passed by on the
other side&mdash;yes, the Priest and the Levite&mdash;the godly ones
who would preserve a whole skin for themselves, and let
the other die of his wounds, for aught they cared! And
here is a young man in distress&mdash;alone and friendless&mdash;and
when he would have a few words of cheerfulness, or a
message, or a scrap of news as to what is going on in the
world&mdash;no, no, say the Priest and the Levite&mdash;go not near
him&mdash;because he is in misfortune he is dangerous&mdash;because
he is alone he is a thief and a murderer&mdash;perchance
a pirate, like Captain Ward and Dansekar, or even Catesby
himself come alive again. I say, God keep us all from
such Christian charity!"</p>

<p>"You use me ill, Judith," said the other, and then was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p><p>They walked on through the meadows, and Judith was
watching the play of the boys. As she did so, a leather
ball, struck a surprising distance, came rolling almost to
her feet, and forthwith one of the lads came running after
it. She picked it up and threw it to him&mdash;threw it awkwardly
and clumsily, as a girl throws, but nevertheless she
saved him some distance and time, and she was rewarded
with many a loud "Thank you! thank you!" from the
side who were out. But when they got past the players
and their noise, Prudence could no longer keep silent;
she had a forgiving disposition, and nothing distressed
her so much as being on unfriendly terms with Judith.</p>

<p>"You know I meant not that, dear Judith," said she.
"I only meant to shield you from harm."</p>

<p>As for Judith, all such trivial and temporary clouds of
misunderstanding were instantly swallowed up in the warm
and radiant sunniness of her nature. She broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>"And so you shall, dear mouse," said she, gayly; "you
shall shield me from the reproach of not having a common
and ordinary share of humanity; that shall you, dear Prue,
should the unfortunate young gentleman come into the
neighborhood again; for you will read to me the message
that he sends me, and together we will devise somewhat
on his behalf. No? Are you afraid to go forth and meet
the pirate Dansekar? Do you expect to find the ghost of
Gamaliel Ratsey walking on the Evesham road? Such
silly fears, dear Prue, do not become you: you are no
longer a child."</p>

<p>"You are laying too heavy a burden on me, Judith," the
other said, rather sadly. "I know not what to do; and
you say I may not ask counsel of any one. And if I do
nothing, I am still taking a part."</p>

<p>"What part, then, but to read a few words and hold
your peace?" said her companion, lightly. "What is that?
But I know you will not stay there, sweet mouse. No,
no; your heart is too tender. I know you would not willingly
do any one an injury, or harbor suspicion and
slander. You shall come and see the young gentleman,
good Prue, as I say; and then you will repent in sackcloth
and ashes for all that you have urged against him. And perchance
it may be in New Place that you shall see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Judith, that were well!" exclaimed the other,
with a brighter light on her face.</p>

<p>"What? Would you desire to see him, if he were to
pay us a visit?" Judith said, regarding her with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>"Surely, surely, after what you have told me: why not,
Judith?" was the placid answer.</p>

<p>"There would be nothing ghostly about him then?"</p>

<p>"There would be no secret, Judith," said Prudence,
gravely, "that you have to keep back from <span class="err" title="original: you">your</span> own people."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we will see what the future holds for us,"
said Judith, in the same careless fashion. "And if the
young gentleman come not back to Stratford, why, then,
good fortune attend him, wherever he may be! for one
that speaks so fair and is so modest sure deserves it.
And if he come not back, then shall your heart be all the
lighter, dear Prue; and as for mine, mine will not be
troubled&mdash;only, that I wish him well, as I say, and would
fain hear of his better estate. So all is so far happily
settled, sweet mouse; and you may go in to supper with
me with untroubled eyes and a free conscience: marry,
there is need for that, as I bethink me; for Master Parson
comes this evening, and you know you must have a pure
and joyful heart with you, good Prudence, when you enter
into the congregation of the saints."</p>

<p>"Judith, for my sake!"</p>

<p>"Nay, I meant not to offend, truly; it was my wicked,
idle tongue, that I must clap a bridle on now&mdash;for,
listen!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were come to New Place. There was singing
going forward within; and one or two of the casements
were open; but perhaps it was the glad and confident
nature of the psalm that led to the words being so clearly
heard without:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The man is blest that hath not bent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To wicked rede his ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor led his life as sinners do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor sat in scorner's chair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the law of God the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doth set his whole delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in that law doth exercise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Himself both day and night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He shall be like the tree that groweth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fast by the river's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which bringeth forth most pleasant fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In her due time and tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose leaf shall never fade nor fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But flourish still and stand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so all things shall prosper well<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That this man takes in hand.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>And so, having waited until the singing ceased, they entered
into the house, and found two or three neighbors
assembled there, and Master Walter was just about to begin
his discourse on the godly life, and the substantial
comfort and sweet peace of mind pertaining thereto.</p>

<hr class="l5" />

<p>Some few days after this, and toward the hour of noon,
the mail-bearer came riding post-haste into the town; and
in due course the contents of his saddle-bags were distributed
among the folk entitled to them. But before the
news-letters had been carefully spelled out to the end, a
strange rumor got abroad. The French king was slain,
and by the hand of an assassin. Some, as the tidings
passed quickly from mouth to mouth, said the murderer
was named Ravelok, others Havelok; but as to the main
fact of the fearful crime having been committed, there
was no manner of doubt. Naturally the bruit of this affair
presently reached Julius Shawe's house; and when the
timid Prudence heard of it&mdash;and when she thought of the
man who had been in hiding, and who had talked with
Judith, and had been so suddenly and secretly summoned
away&mdash;her face grew even paler than its wont, and there
was a sickly dread at her heart. She would go to see
Judith at once; and yet she scarcely dared to breathe even
to herself the terrible forebodings that were crowding in
on her mind.</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>A PLAY-HOUSE.</h3>

<p>But Judith laughed aside these foolish fears; as it happened,
far more important matters were just at this moment
occupying her mind.</p>

<p>She was in the garden. She had brought out some
after-dinner fragments for the Don; and while the great
dun-colored beast devoured these, she had turned from
him to regard Matthew gardener; and there was a sullen
resentment on her face; for it seemed to her imagination
that he kept doggedly and persistently near the summer-house,
on which she had certain dark designs. However,
the instant she caught sight of Prudence, her eyes brightened
up; and, indeed, became full of an eager animation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>"Hither, hither, good Prue!" she exclaimed, hurriedly.
"Quick! quick! I have news for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Judith," said the other; and at the same
moment Judith came to see there was something wrong&mdash;the
startled pale face and frightened eyes had a story to tell.</p>

<p>"Why, what is to do?" said she.</p>

<p>"Know you not, Judith? Have you not heard? The
French king is slain&mdash;murdered by an assassin!"</p>

<p>To her astonishment the news seemed to produce no
effect whatever.</p>

<p>"Well, I am sorry for the poor man," Judith said, with
perfect self-possession. "They that climb high must
sometimes have a sudden fall. But why should that
alarm you, good Prue? Or have you other news that
comes more nearly home?"</p>

<p>And then, when Prudence almost breathlessly revealed
the apprehensions that had so suddenly filled her mind,
Judith would not even stay to discuss such a monstrous
possibility. She laughed it aside altogether. That the
courteous young gentleman who had come with a letter
from Ben Jonson should be concerned in the assassination
of the King of France was entirely absurd and out of the
question.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, good Prue," said she, lightly, "you shall
make him amends for these unjust suspicions; that you
shall, dear mouse, all in good time. But listen now: I
have weightier matters; I have eggs on the spit, beshrew
me else! Can you read me this riddle, sweet Prue?
Know you by these tokens what has happened? My father
comes in to dinner to-day in the gayest of humors;
there is no absent staring at the window, and forgetting
of all of us; it is all merriment this time; and he must
needs have Bess Hall to sit beside him; and he would
charge her with being a witch; and reproach her for our
simple meal, when that she might have given us a banquet
like that of a London Company, with French dishes and
silver flagons of Theologicum, and a memorial to tell each
of us what was coming. And then he would miscall your
brother&mdash;which you know, dear Prudence, he never would
do were he in earnest&mdash;and said he was chamberlain now,
and was conspiring to be made alderman, only that he
might sell building materials to the Corporation and so
make money out of his office. And I know not what else
of jests and laughing; but at length he sent to have the
Evesham roan saddled; and he said that when once he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>had gone along to the sheep-wash to see that the hurdles
were rightly up for the shearing, he would give all the rest
of the day to idleness&mdash;to idleness wholly; and perchance
he might ride over to Broadway to see the shooting-match
going forward there. Now, you wise one, can you guess
what has happened? Know you what is in store for us?
Can you read me the riddle?"</p>

<p>"I see no riddle, Judith," said the other, with puzzled
eyes. "I met your father as I came through the house; and
he asked if Julius were at home: doubtless he would have
him ride to Broadway with him."</p>

<p>"Dear mouse, is that your skill at guessing? But listen
now"&mdash;and here she dropped her voice as she regarded
goodman Matthew, though that personage seemed busily
enough occupied with his watering-can. "This is what
has happened: I know the signs of the weather. Be sure
he has finished the play&mdash;the play that the young prince
Mamillius was in: you remember, good Prue?&mdash;and the
large fair copy is made out and locked away in the little
cupboard, against my father's next going to London; and
the loose sheets are thrown into the oak chest, along with
the others. And now, good Prue, sweet Prue, do you know
what you must manage? Indeed, I dare not go near the
summer-house while that ancient wiseman is loitering
about; and you must coax him, Prue; you must get him
away; sometimes I see his villain eyes watching me, as if
he had suspicion in his mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis your own guilty conscience, Judith," said Prudence,
but with a smile; for she had herself connived at
this offence ere now.</p>

<p>"By fair means or foul, sweet mouse, you must get him
away to the other end of the garden," said she, eagerly;
"for now the Don has nearly finished his dinner, and
goodman-wiseman-fool will wonder if we stay longer here.
Nay, I have it, sweet Prue: you must get him along to the
corner where my mother grows her simples; and you
must keep him there for a space, that I may get out the
right papers; and this is what you must do: you will ask
him for something that sounds like Latin&mdash;no matter what
nonsense it may be; and he will answer you that he
knows it right well, but has none of it at the present time;
and you will say that you have surely seen it among my
mother's simples, and thus you will lead him away to find it
and the longer you seek the better. Do you understand,
good Prue?&mdash;and quick! quick!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p><p>Prudence's pale face flushed.</p>

<p>"You ask too much, Judith. I cannot deceive the poor
man so."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, you are too scrupulous, dear mouse. A
trifle&mdash;a mere trifle."</p>

<p>And then Prudence happened to look up, and she met
Judith's eyes; and there was such frank self-confidence
and audacity in them, and also such a singular and clear-shining
beauty, that the simple Puritan was in a manner
bedazzled. She said, with a quiet smile, as she turned
away her head again:</p>

<p>"Well, I marvel not, Judith, that you can bewitch the
young men, and bewilder their understanding. 'Tis easy
to see&mdash;if they have eyes and regard you, they are lost;
but how you have your own way with all of us, and how
you override our judgment, and do with us what you
please, that passes me. Even Dr. Hall: for whom else
would he have brought from Coventry the green silk
stockings and green velvet shoes?&mdash;you know such vanities
find little favor in his own home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, sweetheart, muzzle me that gaping ancient!"
said Judith, interrupting her. "The Don has
finished; and I will dart into the summer-house as I carry
back the dish. Detain him, sweet Prue; speak a word or
two of Latin to him; he will swear he understands you
right well, though you yourself understand not a word of
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I may not do all you ask, Judith," said the other, after
a moment's reflection (and still with an uneasy feeling
that she was yielding to the wiles of a temptress), "but I
will ask the goodman to show me your mother's simples,
and how they thrive."</p>

<p>A minute or two thereafter Judith had swiftly stolen
into the summer-house&mdash;which was spacious and substantial
of its kind, and contained a small black cupboard
fixed up in a corner of the walls, a table and chair,
and a long oak chest on the floor. It was this last that
held the treasure she was in search of; and now, the lid
having been raised, she was down on one knee, carefully
selecting from a mass of strewn papers (indeed, there were
a riding-whip, a sword and sword-belt, and several other
articles mixed up in this common receptacle) such sheets
as were without a minute mark which she had invented
for her own private purposes. These secured and hastily
hidden in her sleeve, she closed the lid, and went out into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>the open again, calling upon Prudence to come to her, for
that she was going into the house.</p>

<p>They did not, however, remain within-doors at New
Place, for that might have been dangerous; they knew of
a far safer resort. Just behind Julius Shawe's house, and
between that and the garden, there was a recess formed
by the gable of a large barn not quite reaching the adjacent
wall. It was a three-sided retreat; overlooked by no
window whatsoever; there was a frail wooden bench on
two sides of it, and the entrance to it was partly blocked
up by an empty cask that had been put there to be out of
the way. For outlook there was nothing but a glimpse of
the path going into the garden, a bit of greensward, and
two apple-trees between them and the sky. It was not a
noble theatre, this little den behind the barn; but it had
produced for these two many a wonderful pageant; for
the empty barrel and the bare barn wall and the two trees
would at one time be transformed into the forest of Arden,
and Rosalind would be walking there in her pretty
page costume, and laughing at the love-sick Orlando;
and again they would form the secret haunts of Queen
Titania and her court, with the jealous Oberon chiding
her for her refusal; and again they would become the
hall of a great northern castle, with trumpets and cannon
sounding without as the King drank to Hamlet. Indeed,
the elder of these two young women had an extraordinarily
vivid imagination; she saw the things and people as if
they were actually there before her; she realized their existence
so intensely that even Prudence was brought to
sympathize with them, and to follow their actions now
with hot indignation, and now with triumphant delight
over good fortune come at last. There was no stage-carpenter
there to distract them with his dismal expedients; no
actor to thrust his physical peculiarities between them and
the poet's ethereal visions; the dream-world was before
them, clear and filled with light; and Prudence's voice
was gentle and of a musical kind. Nay, sometimes Judith
would leap to her feet. "You shall not!&mdash;you shall not!"
she would exclaim, as if addressing some strange visitant
that was showing the villainy of his mind; and tears came
quickly to her eyes if there was a tale of pity; and the
joy and laughter over lovers reconciled brought warm
color to her face. They forgot that these walls that enclosed
them were of gray mud; they forgot that the prevailing
odor in the air was that of the malt in the barn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>for now they were regarding Romeo in the moonlight,
with the dusk of the garden around, and Juliet uttering
her secrets to the honeyed night; and again they were listening
to the awful voices of the witches on the heath, and
guessing at the sombre thoughts passing through the
mind of Macbeth; and then again they were crying bitterly
when they saw before them an old man, gray-haired,
discrowned, and witless, that looked from one to the other
of those standing by, and would ask who the sweet lady
was that sought with tears for his benediction. They
could hear the frail and shaken voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Methinks I should know you, and know this man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What place this is: and all the skill I have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembers not these garments; nor I know not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as I am a man, I think this lady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be my child Cordelia."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now, as they had retired into this sheltered nook,
and Prudence was carefully placing in order the scattered
sheets that had been given her, Judith was looking on with
some compunction.</p>

<p>"Indeed I grieve to give you so much trouble, sweetheart,"
said she. "I would I could get at the copy that
my father has locked away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judith!" her friend said, reproachfully. "You would
not take that? Why, your father will scarce show it even
to Julius, and sure I am that none in the house would put
a hand upon it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it were a book of psalms and paraphrases, they
might be of another mind," Judith said; but Prudence
would not hear.</p>

<p>"Nay," said she, as she continued to search for the connecting
pages. "I have heard your father say to Julius
that there is but little difference; and that 'tis only when
he has leisure here in Stratford that he makes this copy
writ out fair and large; in London he takes no such pains.
Truly I would not that either Julius or any of his acquaintance
knew of my fingering in such a matter: what would
they say, Judith? And sometimes, indeed, my mind is ill
at ease with regard to it&mdash;that I should be reading to you
things that so many godly people denounce as wicked and
dangerous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are too full of fears, good mouse," said Judith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>coolly, "and too apt to take the good people at their word.
Nay, I have heard; they will make you out everything to
be wicked and sinful that is not to their own minds; and
they are zealous among the saints; but I have heard, I
have heard."</p>

<p>"What, then?" said the other, with some faint color in
her face.</p>

<p>"No matter," said Judith, carelessly. "Well, I have
heard that when they make a journey to London they are
as fond of claret wine and oysters as any; but no matter:
in truth the winds carry many a thing not worth the listening
to. But as regards this special wickedness, sweet
mouse, indeed you are innocent of it; 'tis all laid to my
charge; I am the sinner and temptress; be sure you shall
not suffer one jot through my iniquity. And now have
you got them all together? Are you ready to begin?"</p>

<p>"But you must tell me where the story ceased, dear
Judith, when last we had it; for indeed you have a marvellous
memory, even to the word and the letter. The
poor babe that was abandoned on the sea-shore had just
been found by the old shepherd&mdash;went it not so?&mdash;and he
was wondering at the rich bearing-cloth it was wrapped
in. Why, here is the name&mdash;Perdita," she continued, as
she rapidly scanned one or two of the papers&mdash;"who is now
grown up, it appears, and in much grace; and this is a kind
of introduction, I take it, to tell you all that has happened
since your father last went to London&mdash;I mean since the
story was broken off. And Florizel&mdash;I remember not the
name&mdash;but here he is so named as the son of the King of
Bohemia&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A quick laugh of intelligence rose to Judith's eyes; she
had an alert brain.</p>

<p>"Prince Florizel?" she exclaimed. "And Princess
Perdita! That were a fair match, in good sooth, and a
way to heal old differences. But to the beginning, sweetheart,
I beseech you; let us hear how the story is to be;
and pray Heaven he gives me back my little Mamillius,
that was so petted and teased by the court ladies."</p>

<p>However, as speedily appeared, she had anticipated too
easy a continuation and conclusion. The young Prince
Florizel proved to be enamored, not of one of his own station,
but of a simple shepherdess; and although she instantly
guessed that this shepherdess might turn out to be
the forsaken Perdita, the conversation between King Polixenes
and the good Camillo still left her in doubt. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>for the next scene&mdash;the encounter between Autolycus and
the country clown&mdash;Judith wholly and somewhat sulkily
disapproved of that. She laughed, it is true; but it was
sorely against her will. For she suspected that goodman
Matthew's influence was too apparent here; and that,
were he ever to hear of the story, he would in his vanity
claim this part as his own; moreover, there was a kind of
familiarity and every-day feeling in the atmosphere&mdash;why,
she herself had been rapidly questioned by her father
about the necessary purchases for a sheep-shearing feast,
and Susan, laughing, had struck in with the information
as to the saffron for coloring the warden-pies. But when
the sweet-voiced Prudence came to the scene between
Prince Florizel and the pretty shepherdess, then Judith
was right well content.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you see, now, how her gentle birth shines
through her lowly condition!" she said, quickly. "And
when the old shepherd finds that he has been ordering a
king's daughter to be the mistress of the feast&mdash;ay, and
soundly rating her, too, for her bashful ways&mdash;what a
fright will seize the good old man! And what says she in
answer?&mdash;again, good Prue&mdash;let me hear it again&mdash;marry,
now, I'll be sworn she had just such another voice as
yours!"</p>

<p>"To the King Polixenes," Prudence continued, regarding
the manuscript, "who is in disguise, you know, Judith,
she says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'Welcome, sir!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is my father's will I should take on me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hostess-ship o' the day:&mdash;you're welcome, sir.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And then to both the gentlemen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.&mdash;Reverend sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeming and savor all the winter long:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grace and remembrance be to you both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcome to our shearing!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ah, there, now, will they not be won by her gentleness?"
she cried, eagerly. "Will they not suspect and
discover the truth? It were a new thing for a prince to
wed a shepherdess, but this is no shepherdess, as an owl
might see! What say they then, Prue? Have they no
suspicion?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>So Prudence continued her patient reading&mdash;in the intense
silence that was broken only by the twittering of the
birds in the orchard, or the crowing of a cock in some
neighboring yard; and Judith listened keenly, drinking
in every varying phrase. But when Florizel had addressed
his speech to the pretty hostess of the day, Judith could
no longer forbear: she clapped her hands in delight.</p>

<p>"There, now, that is a true lover; that is spoken like a
true lover," she cried, with her face radiant and proud.
"Again, good Prue&mdash;let us hear what he says&mdash;ay, and before
them all, too, I warrant me he is not ashamed of
her."</p>

<p>So Prudence had to read once more Florizel's praise of
his gentle mistress:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"'What you do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd have you do it ever: when you sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd have you buy and sell so; so give alms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing but that; move still, still so, and own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other function. Each your doing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So singular in each particular,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all your acts are queens!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In good sooth, it is spoken like a true lover," Judith
said, with a light on her face as if the speech had been addressed
to herself. "Like one that is well content with
his sweetheart, and is proud of her, and approves! Marry,
there be few of such in these days; for this one is jealous
and unreasonable, and would have the mastery too soon;
and that one would frighten you to his will by declaring
you are on the highway to perdition; and another would
have you more civil to his tribe of kinsfolk. But there is
a true lover, now; there is one that is courteous and gentle;
one that is not afraid to approve: there may be such in
Stratford, but God wot, they would seem to be a scarce
commodity! Nay, I pray your pardon, good Prue: to the
story, if it please you&mdash;and is there aught of the little
Mamillius forthcoming?"</p>

<p>And so the reading proceeded; and Judith was in much
delight that the old King seemed to perceive something unusual
in the grace and carriage of the pretty Perdita.</p>

<p>"What is't he says? What are the very words?"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
<span class="i0">"'This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran on the greensward: nothing she does or seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But smacks of something greater than herself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too noble for this place.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes! yes! yes!" she exclaimed, quickly. "And sees
he not some likeness to the Queen Hermione? Surely he
must remember the poor injured Queen, and see that this
is her daughter? Happy daughter, that has a lover that
thinks so well of her! And now, Prue?"</p>

<p>But when in the course of the hushed reading all these
fair hopes came to be cruelly shattered; when the pastoral
romance was brought to a sudden end; when the
King, disclosing himself, declared a divorce between the
unhappy lovers, and was for hanging the ancient shepherd,
and would have Perdita's beauty scratched with briers;
and when Prudence had to repeat the farewell words addressed
to the prince by his hapless sweetheart&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"'Wilt please you, sir, be gone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your own state take care: this dream of mine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch further,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But milk my ewes, and weep&mdash;'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">there was something very like tears in the gentle reader's
eyes; but that was not Judith's mood; she was in a
tempest of indignation.</p>

<p>"God's my life!" she cried, "was there ever such a
fool as this old King? He a king! He to sit on a throne!
Better if he sate in a barn and helped madge-howlet to
catch mice! And what says the prince? Nay, I'll be
sworn he proves himself a true man, and no summer playfellow;
he will stand by her; he will hold to her, let the
ancient dotard wag his beard as he please!"</p>

<p>And so, in the end, the story was told, and all happily
settled; and Prudence rose from the rude wooden bench
with a kind of wistful look on her face, as if she had been
far away, and seen strange things. Then Judith&mdash;pausing
for a minute or so as if she would fix the whole thing in
her memory, to be thought over afterward&mdash;proceeded to
tie the pages together for the better concealment of them
on her way home.</p>

<p>"And the wickedness of it?" said she, lightly. "Wherein
lies the wickedness of such a reading, sweet mouse?"</p>

<p>Prudence was somewhat shamefaced on such occasions;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>she could not honestly say that she regretted as she ought
to have done, giving way to Judith's importunities.</p>

<p>"Some would answer you, Judith," she said, "that we
had but ill used time that was given us for more serious
purposes."</p>

<p>"And for what more serious purposes, good gossip?
For the repeating of idle tales about our neighbors? Or
the spending of the afternoon in sleep, as is the custom
with many? Are we all so busy, then, that we may not
pass a few minutes in amusement? But, indeed, sweet
Prue," said she, as she gave a little touch to her pretty
cap and snow-white ruff, to put them right before she
went out into the street, "I mean to make amends this afternoon.
I shall be busy enough to make up for whatever
loss of time there has been over this dangerous and godless
idleness. For, do you know, I have everything ready
now for the new Portugal receipts that you read to me;
and two of them I am to try as soon as I get home; and
my father is to know nothing of the matter&mdash;till the dishes
be on the table. So fare you well, sweet mouse; and give
ye good thanks, too: this has been but an evil preparation
for the church-going of the morrow, but remember, the
sin was mine&mdash;you are quit of that."</p>

<p>And then her glance fell on the roll of papers that she
held in her hand.</p>

<p>"The pretty Perdita!" said she. "Her beauty was not
scratched with briers, after all. And I doubt not she was
in brave attire at the court; though methinks I better like
to remember her as the mistress of the feast, giving the
flowers to this one and that. And happy Perdita, also, to
have the young prince come to the sheep-shearing, and
say so many sweet things to her! Is't possible, think you,
Prue, there might come such another handsome stranger
to our sheep-shearing that is now at hand?"</p>

<p>"I know not what you mean, Judith."</p>

<p>"Why, now, should such things happen only in Bohemia?"
she said, gayly, to the gentle and puzzled Prudence,
"Soon our shearing will begin, for the weather has been
warm, and I hear the hurdles are already fixed. And
there will be somewhat of a merry-making, no doubt; and&mdash;and
the road from Evesham hither is a fair and goodly
road, that a handsome young stranger might well come
riding along. What then, good mouse? If one were to
meet him in the lane that crosses to Shottery&mdash;and to bid
him to the feast&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>"Oh, Judith, surely you are not still thinking of that
dangerous man!" the other exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Judith merely regarded her for a second, with the
clear-shining eyes now become quite demure and inscrutable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>A REMONSTRANCE.</h3>

<p>Next morning was Sunday; and Judith, having got
through her few domestic duties at an early hour, and being
dressed in an especially pretty costume in honor of
the holy day, thought she need no longer remain within-doors,
but would walk along to the church-yard, where
she expected to find Prudence. The latter very often
went thither on a Sunday morning, partly for quiet reverie
and recalling of this one and the other of her departed
but not forgotten friends whose names were carven on the
tombstones, and partly&mdash;if this may be forgiven her&mdash;to
see how the generous mother earth had responded to her
week-day labors in the planting and tending of the graves.
But when Judith, idly and carelessly as was her wont,
reached the church-yard, she found the wide, silent space
quite empty; so she concluded that Prudence had probably
been detained by a visit to some one fallen sick; and
she thought she might as well wait for her; and with that
view&mdash;or perhaps out of mere thoughtlessness&mdash;she went
along to the river-side, and sat down on the low wall there,
having before her the slowly moving yellow stream and
the fair, far-stretching landscape beyond.</p>

<p>There had been some rain during the night; the roads
she had come along were miry; and here the grass in the
church-yard was dripping with the wet; but there was a
kind of suffused rich light abroad that bespoke the gradual
breaking through of the sun; and there was a warmth
in the moist atmosphere that seemed to call forth all kinds
of sweet odors from the surrounding plants and flowers.
Not that she needed these, for she had fixed in her bosom
a little nosegay of yellow-leaved mint, that was quite sufficient
to sweeten the scarcely moving air. And as she
sat there in the silence it seemed to her as if all the world
were awake&mdash;and had been awake for hours&mdash;but that all
the human beings were gone out of it. The rooks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>cawing in the elms above her; the bees hummed as they
flew by into the open light over the stream; and far away
she could hear the lowing of the cattle on the farms; but
there was no sound of any human voice, nor any glimpse
of any human creature in the wide landscape. And she
grew to wonder what it would be like if she were left alone
in the world, all the people gone from it, her own relatives
and friends no longer here and around her, but away
in the strange region where Hamnet was, and perhaps, on
such a morning as this, regarding her not without pity, and
even, it might be, with some touch of half-recalled affection.
Which of them all should she regret the most?
Which of them all would this solitary creature&mdash;left alone
in Stratford, in an empty town&mdash;most crave for, and feel
the want of? Well, she went over these friends and neighbors
and companions and would-be lovers; and she tried
to imagine what, in such circumstances, she might think
of this one and that; and which of them she would most
desire to have back on the earth and living with her. But
right well she knew in her heart that all this balancing and
choosing was but a pretence. There was but the one;
the one whose briefest approval was a kind of heaven to
her, and the object of her secret and constant desire; the
one who turned aside her affection with a jest; who
brought her silks and scents from London as if her mind
were set on no other things than these. And she was beginning
to wonder whether, in those imagined circumstances,
he might come to think differently of her and to
understand her somewhat; and indeed she was already
picturing to herself the life they might lead&mdash;these two,
father and daughter, together in the empty and silent but
sun-lit and sufficiently cheerful town&mdash;when her idle reverie
was interrupted. There was a sound of talking behind
her; doubtless the first of the people were now coming
to church; for the doors were already open.</p>

<p>She looked round, and saw that this was Master Walter
Blaise who had just come through the little swinging gate,
and that he was accompanied by two little girls, one at
each side of him, and holding his hand. Instantly she
turned her head away, pretending not to have seen him.</p>

<p>"Bless the man!" she said to herself, "what does he
here of a Sunday morning? Why is so diligent a pastor
not in charge of his own flock?"</p>

<p>But she felt secure enough. Not only was he accompanied
by the two children, but there was this other safeguard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>that he would not dare to profane the holy day by
attempting anything in the way of wooing. And it must
be said that the young parson had had but few opportunities
for that, the other members of the household eagerly
seeking his society when he came to New Place, and Judith
sharp to watch her chances of escape.</p>

<p>The next moment she was startled by hearing a quick
footstep behind her. She did not move.</p>

<p>"Give you good-morrow, Judith," said he, presenting
himself, and regarding her with his keen and confident
gray eyes. "I would crave a word with you; and I trust
it may be a word in season, and acceptable to you."</p>

<p>He spoke with an air of cool authority, which she resented.
There was nothing of the clownish bashfulness
of young Jelleyman about him; nor yet of the half-timid,
half-sulky jealousy of Tom Quiney; but a kind of mastery,
as if his office gave him the right to speak, and commanded
that she should hear. And she did not think this fair,
and she distinctly wished to be alone; so that her face had
but little welcome in it, and none of the shining radiance
of kindness that Willy Hart so worshipped.</p>

<p>"I know you like not hearing of serious things, Judith,"
said he (while she wondered whither he had sent the two
little girls: perhaps into the church?), "but I were no
true friend to you, as I desire to be, if I feared to displease
you when there is need."</p>

<p>"What have I done, then? In what have I offended?
I know we are all miserable sinners, if that be what you
mean," said she, coldly.</p>

<p>"I would not have you take it that way, Judith," said
he; and there really was much friendliness in his voice.
"I meant to speak kindly to you. Nay, I have tried to
understand you; and perchance I do in a measure. You
are in the enjoyment of such health and spirits as fall to
the lot of few; you are well content with your life and the
passing moment; you do not like to be disturbed, or to
think of the future. But the future will come, nevertheless,
and it may be with altered circumstances; your light-heartedness
may cease, sorrow and sickness may fall upon
you, and then you may wish you had learned earlier to seek
for help and consolation where these alone are to be found.
It were well that you should think of such things now,
surely; you cannot live always as you live now&mdash;I had
almost said a godless life, but I do not wish to offend; in
truth, I would rather lead you in all kindliness to what I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>know is the true pathway to the happiness and peace of
the soul. I would speak to you, Judith, if in no other way,
as a brother in Christ; I were no true friend to you else;
nay, I have the command of the Master whom I serve to
speak and fear not."</p>

<p>She did not answer, but she was better content now.
So long as he only preached at her, he was within his
province, and within his right.</p>

<p>"And bethink you, Judith," said he, with a touch of reproach
in his voice, "how and why it is you enjoy such
health and cheerfulness of spirits; surely through the
Lord in His loving-kindness answering the prayers of your
pious mother. Your life, one might say, was vouchsafed
in answer to her supplications; and do you owe nothing
of duty and gratitude to God, and to God's Church, and
to God's people? Why should you hold aloof from them?
Why should you favor worldly things, and walk apart from
the congregation, and live as if to-morrow were always to
be as to-day, and as if there were to be no end to life, no
calling to account as to how we have spent our time here
upon earth? Dear Judith, I speak not unkindly; I wish
not to offend; but often my heart is grieved for you; and
I would have you think how trifling our present life is in
view of the great eternity whither we are all journeying;
and I would ask you, for your soul's sake, and for your
peace of mind here and hereafter, to join with us, and
come closer with us, and partake of our exercises. Indeed
you will find a truer happiness. Do you not owe it to us?
Have you no gratitude for the answering of your mother's
prayers?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless, doubtless," said she (though she would
rather have been listening in silence to the singing of the
birds, that were all rejoicing now, for the sun had at length
cleared away the morning vapors, and the woods and the
meadows and the far uplands were all shining in the brilliant
new light). "I go to church as the others do, and
there we give thanks for all the mercies that have been
granted."</p>

<p>"And is it enough, think you?" said he&mdash;and as he
stood, while she sat, she did not care to meet those clear,
keen, authoritative eyes that were bent on her. "Does
your conscience tell you that you give sufficient thanks for
what God in His great mercy has vouchsafed to you?
Lip-service every seventh day!&mdash;a form of words gone
through before you take your afternoon walk! Why, if a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>neighbor were kind to you, you would show him as much
gratitude as that; and this is all you offer to the Lord of
heaven and earth for having in His compassion listened
to your mother's prayers, and bestowed on you life and
health and a cheerful mind?"</p>

<p>"What would you have me do? I cannot profess to be
a saint while at heart I am none," said she, somewhat
sullenly.</p>

<p>It was an unlucky question. Moreover, at this moment
the bells in the tower sent forth their first throbbing peals
into the startled air; and these doubtless recalled him to
the passing of time, and the fact that presently the people
would be coming into the church-yard.</p>

<p>"I will speak plainly to you, Judith; I take no shame
to mention such a matter on the Lord's day; perchance the
very holiness of the hour and of the spot where I have
chanced to meet you will the better incline your heart.
You know what I have wished; what your family wish;
and indeed you cannot be so blind as not to have seen.
It is true, I am but a humble laborer in the Lord's vineyard;
but I magnify my office; it is an honorable work;
the saving of souls, the calling to repentance, the carrying
of the Gospel to the poor and stricken ones of the earth&mdash;I
say that is an honorable calling, and one that blesses
them that partake in it, and gives a peace of mind far
beyond what the worldlings dream of. And if I have
wished that you might be able and willing&mdash;through God's
merciful inclining of your heart&mdash;to aid me in this work,
to become my helpmeet, was it only of my own domestic
state I was thinking? Surely not. I have seen you from
day to day&mdash;careless and content with the trifles and idle
things of this vain and profitless world; but I have looked
forward to what might befall in the future, and I have desired
with all my heart&mdash;yea, and with prayers to God for
the same&mdash;that you should be taught to seek the true
haven in time of need. Do you understand me, Judith?"</p>

<p>He spoke with little tenderness, and certainly with no
show of lover-like anxiety; but he was in earnest; and
she had a terrible conviction pressing upon her that her
wit might not be able to save her. The others she could
easily elude when she was in the mind; this one spoke
close and clear; she was afraid to look up and face his
keen, acquisitive eyes.</p>

<p>"And if I do understand you, good Master Blaise," said
she desperately; "if I do understand you&mdash;as I confess I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>have gathered something of this before&mdash;but&mdash;but surely&mdash;one
such as I&mdash;such as you say I am&mdash;might she not become
pious&mdash;and seek to have her soul saved&mdash;without
also having to marry a parson?&mdash;if such be your meaning,
good Master Blaise."</p>

<p>It was she who was in distress and in embarrassment;
not he.</p>

<p>"You are not situated as many others are," said he.
"You owe your life, as one may say, to the prayers of
God's people; I but put before you one way in which you
could repay the debt&mdash;by laboring in the Lord's vineyard,
and giving the health and cheerfulness that have been bestowed
on you to the comfort of those less fortunate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I? Such a one as I? Nay, nay, you have shown me
how all unfit I were for that," she exclaimed, glad of this
one loophole.</p>

<p>"I will not commend you, Judith, to your face," said he,
calmly, "nor praise such worldly gifts as others, it may be,
overvalue; but in truth I may say you have a way of winning
people toward you; your presence is welcome to the
sick; your cheerfulness gladdens the troubled in heart;
and you have youth and strength and an intelligence beyond
that of many. Are all these to be thrown away?&mdash;to
wither and perish as the years go by? Nay, I seek not to
urge my suit to you by idle words of wooing, as they call
it, or by allurements of flattery; these are the foolish devices
of the ballad-mongers and the players, and are well
fitted, I doubt not, for the purposes of the master of these,
the father of lies himself; rather would I speak to you
words of sober truth and reason; I would show you how
you can make yourself useful in the garden of the Lord,
and so offer some thanksgiving for the bounties bestowed
on you. Pray consider it, Judith; I ask not for yea or
nay at this moment; I would have your heart meditate
over it in your own privacy, when you can bethink you of
what has happened to you and what may happen to you
in the future. Life has been glad for you so far; but
trouble might come; your relatives are older than you;
you might be left so that you would be thankful to have
one beside you whose arm you could lean on in time of
distress. Think over it, Judith, and may God incline your
heart to what is right and best for you."</p>

<p>But at this moment the first of the early comers began
to make their appearance&mdash;strolling along toward the
church-yard, and chatting to each other as they came&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>all at once it occurred to her that if he and she separated
thus, he might consider that she had given some
silent acquiescence to his reasons and arguments; and
this possibility alarmed her.</p>

<p>"Good Master Blaise," said she, hurriedly, "pray mistake
me not. Surely, if you are choosing a helpmeet for
such high and holy reasons, it were well that you looked further
afield. I am all unworthy for such a place&mdash;indeed I
know it; there is not a maid in Stratford that would not better
become it; nay, for my own part, I know several that I
could point out to you, though your own judgment were
best in such a matter. I pray you think no more of me in
regard to such a position; God help me, I should make a
parson's wife such as all the neighbors would stare at; indeed
I know there be many you could choose from&mdash;if
their heart were set in that direction&mdash;that are far better
than I."</p>

<p>And with this protest she would fain have got away; and
she was all anxiety to catch a glimpse of Prudence, whose
appearance would afford her a fair excuse. How delightful
would be the silence of the great building and the security
of the oaken pew! with what a peace of mind would
she regard the soft-colored beams of light streaming into
the chancel, and listen to the solemn organ music, and
wait for the silver-clear tones of Susan's voice! But good
Master Walter would have another word with her ere allowing
her to depart.</p>

<p>"In truth you misjudge yourself, Judith," said he, with
a firm assurance, as if he could read her heart far better
than she herself. "I know more of the duties pertaining
to such a station than you; I can foresee that you would
fulfil them worthily, and in a manner pleasing to the Lord.
Your parents, too: will you not consider their wishes before
saying a final nay?"</p>

<p>"My parents?" she said, and she looked up with a
quick surprise. "My mother, it may be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if your father were to approve also?"</p>

<p>For an instant her heart felt like lead; but before this
sudden fright had had time to tell its tale in her eyes she
had reassured herself. This was not possible.</p>

<p>"Has my father expressed any such wish?" said she;
but well she knew what the reply would be.</p>

<p>"No, he has not, Judith," he said, distinctly; "for I
have not spoken to him. But if I were to obtain his approval,
would that influence you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p><p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"I should not despair of gaining that," said he, with a
calm confidence that caused her to lift her eyes and regard
him for a second, with a kind of wonder, as it were, for
she knew not what this assurance meant. "Your father,"
he continued, "must naturally desire to see your future
made secure, Judith. Think what would happen to you
all if an accident befell him on his journeyings to London.
There would be no man to protect you and your mother.
Dr. Hall has his own household and its charges, and two
women left by themselves would surely feel the want of
guidance and help. If I put these worldly considerations
before you, it is with no wish that you should forget the
higher duty you owe to God and his Church, and the
care you should have of your own soul. Do I speak for
myself alone? I think not. I trust it is not merely selfish
hopes that have bidden me appeal to you. And you
will reflect, Judith; you will commune with yourself before
saying the final yea or nay; and if your father should approve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good Master Blaise," said she, interrupting him&mdash;and
she rose and glanced toward the straggling groups now approaching
the church&mdash;"I cannot forbid you to speak to
my father, if it is your wish to do that; but I would have
him understand that it is through no desire of mine; and&mdash;and,
in truth, he must know that I am all unfit to take
the charge you would put upon me. I pray you hold it
in kindness that I say so:&mdash;and there, now," she quickly
added, "is little Willie Hart, that I have a message for,
lest he escape me when we come out again."</p>

<p>He could not further detain her; but he accompanied
her as she walked along the path toward the little swinging
gate, for she could see that her small cousin, though he
had caught sight of her, was shyly uncertain as to whether
he should come to her, and she wished to have his hand
as far as the church door. And then&mdash;alas! that such
things should befall&mdash;at the very same moment a number
of the young men and maidens also entered the church-yard;
and foremost among them was Tom Quiney. One
rapid glance that he directed toward her and the parson
was all that passed; but instantly in her heart of hearts
she knew the suspicion that he had formed. An assignation?&mdash;and
on a Sunday morning, too! Nay, her guess
was quickly confirmed. He did not stay to pay her even
the ordinary courtesy of a greeting. He went on with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>others; he was walking with two of the girls; his laughter
and talk were louder than any. Indeed, this unseemly
mirth was continued to within a yard or two of the church
door&mdash;perhaps it was meant for her to hear?</p>

<p>Little Willie Hart, as he and his cousin Judith went
hand in hand through the porch, happened to look up at
her.</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, "why are you crying?"</p>

<p>"I am not!" she said, angrily. And with her hand she
dashed aside those quick tears of vexation.</p>

<p>The boy did not pay close heed to what now went on
within the hushed building. He was wondering over
what had occurred&mdash;for these mysteries were beyond his
years. But at least he knew that his cousin Judith was
no longer angry with him; for she had taken him into the
pew with her, and her arm, that was interlinked with his,
was soft and warm and gentle to the touch; and once or
twice, when the service bade them to stand up, she had
put her hand kindly on his hair. And not only that, but
she had at the outset taken from her bosom the little nosegay
of mint and given it to him; and the perfume of it
(for it was Judith's gift, and she had worn it near her heart,
and she had given it him with a velvet touch of her fingers)
seemed to him a strange and sweet and mystical
thing&mdash;something almost as strange and sweet and inexplicable
as the beauty and shining tenderness of her eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>DIVIDED WAYS.</h3>

<p>Some few weeks passed quite uneventfully, bringing
them to the end of June; and then it was that Mistress
Hathaway chanced to send a message into the town that
she would have her granddaughter Judith come over to
see her roses, of which there was a great show in the garden.
Judith was nothing loath; she felt she had somewhat
neglected the old dame of late; and so, one morning&mdash;or
rather one midday it was, for the family had but finished
dinner&mdash;found her in her own room, before her mirror,
busy with an out-of-door toilet, with Prudence sitting patiently
by. Judith seemed well content with herself and
with affairs in general on this warm summer day; now she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>spoke to Prudence, again she idly sang a scrap of some
familiar song, while the work of adornment went on apace.</p>

<p>"But why such bravery, Judith?" her friend said, with
a quiet smile. "Why should you take such heed about a
walk through the fields to Shottery?"</p>

<p>"Truly I know not," said Judith, carelessly; "but well
I wot my grandmother will grumble. If I am soberly
dressed, she says I am a sloven, and will never win me a
husband; and if I am pranked out, she says I am vain, and
will frighten away the young men with my pride. In
Heaven's name, let them go, say I; I can do excellent
well without them. What think you of the cap, good
Prue? 'Twas but last night I finished it, and the beads I
had from Warwick."</p>

<p>She took it up and regarded it, humming the while:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O say, my Joan, say, my Joan, will not that do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot come every day to woo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Is't not a pretty cap, good gossip?"</p>

<p>Prudence knew that she ought to despise such frivolities,
which truly were a snare to her, for she liked to look at
Judith when she was dressed as she was now, and she forgot
to condemn these pretty colors. On this occasion
Judith was clad in a gown of light gray, or rather buff,
with a petticoat of pale blue taffeta, elaborately quilted
with her own handiwork; the small ruff she wore, which
was open in front, and partly showed her neck, was snow-white
and stiffly starched; and she was now engaged in
putting on her soft brown hair this cap of gray velvet,
adorned with two rows of brass beads, and with a bit of
curling feather at the side of it. Prudence's eyes were
pleased, if her conscience bade her disapprove; nay, sometimes
she had to confess that at heart she was proud to see
her dear gossip wear such pretty things, for that she became
them so well.</p>

<p>"Judith," said she, "shall I tell you what I heard your
father say of you last night? He was talking to Julius, and
they were speaking of this one and that, and how they did;
and when you were mentioned, 'Oh yes,' says your father,
'the wench looks bravely well; 'tis a pity she cannot sell
the painting of her cheeks: there may be many a dame at
the court would buy it of her for a goodly sum.'"</p>

<p>Judith gave a quick, short laugh: this was music in her
ears&mdash;coming from whence it did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>"But, Judith," said her friend, with a grave inquiry in
her face, "what is't that you have done to Tom Quiney
that he comes no longer near the house?&mdash;nay, he will
avoid you when he happens to see you abroad, for that I
have observed myself, and more than once. What is the
matter? How have you offended him?"</p>

<p>"What have I done?" she said; and there was a swift
and angry color in her face. "Let him ask what his own
evil imaginings have done. Not that I care, in good
sooth!"</p>

<p>"But what is it, Judith? There must be a reason."</p>

<p>"Why," said Judith, turning indignantly to her, "you
remember, sweetheart, the Sunday morning that Mrs.
Pike's little boy was taken ill, and you were sent for, and
did not come to church? Well, I had gone along to the
church-yard to seek you, and was waiting for you, when who
must needs make his appearance but the worthy Master
Blaise&mdash;nay, but I told you, good Prue, the honor he would
put upon me; and, thank Heaven, he hath not returned to
it, nor spoken to my father yet, as far as I can learn. Then,
when the good parson's sermon was over&mdash;body o' me, he
let me know right sharply I was no saint, though a saint I
might become, no doubt, were I to take him for my master&mdash;as
I say, the lecture he gave me was over, and we were walking
to the church door, when who should come by but Master
Quiney and some of the others. Oh, well I know my gentleman!
The instant he clapped eyes on me he suspected
there had been a planned meeting&mdash;I could see it well&mdash;and
off he goes in high dudgeon, and not a word nor a look&mdash;before
the others, mind you, before the others, good Prue;
that was the slight he put upon me. Marry, I care not!
Whither he has gone, there he may stay!"</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly and with warmth: despite the scorn
that was in her voice, it was clear that that public slight
had touched her deeply.</p>

<p>"Nay, Judith," said her gentle companion, "'twere surely
a world of pity you should let an old friend go away like
that&mdash;through a mischance merely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An old friend?" said she. "I want none of such
friends, that have ill thoughts of you ere you can speak.
Let him choose his friends elsewhere, say I; let him keep
to his tapsters, and his ale-house wenches; there he will
have enough of pleasure, I doubt not, till his head be broke
in a brawl some night!"</p>

<p>Then something seemed to occur to her. All at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>she threw aside the bit of ribbon she had in her fingers,
and dropped on her knee before her friend, and seized
hold of Prudence's hands.</p>

<p>"I beseech your pardon, sweet Prue!&mdash;indeed, indeed,
I knew not what I said; they were but idle words; good
mouse, I pray you heed them not. He may have reasons
for distrusting me; and in truth I complain not; 'tis a
small matter; but I would not have you think ill of him
through these idle words of mine. Nay, nay, they tell me
he is sober and diligent, that his business prospers, that
he makes many friends, and that the young men regard
him as the chief of them, whether it be at merriment or
aught else."</p>

<p>"I am right glad to hear you speak so of the young man,
Judith," Prudence said, in her gentle way, and yet mildly
wondering at this sudden change of tone. "If he has displeased
you, be sure he will be sorry for it, when he knows
the truth."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, sweet mouse," Judith said, rising and resuming
her careless manner, as she picked up the ribbon she
had thrown aside. "'Tis of no moment. I wish the young
man well. I pray you speak to none of that I have told you;
perchance 'twas but an accident, and he meant no slight
at all; and then&mdash;and then," she added, with a kind of
laugh, "as the good parson seems determined that willy-nilly
I must wed him and help him in his charge of souls,
that were a good ending, sweet Prue?"</p>

<p>She was now all equipped for setting forth, even to the
feather fan that hung from her girdle by a small silver cord.</p>

<p>"But I know he hath not spoken to my father yet, else I
should have heard of it, in jest or otherwise. Come, mouse,
shall we go? or the good dame will have a scolding for us."</p>

<p>Indeed, this chance reference to the slight put upon her
in the church-yard seemed to have left no sting behind it.
She was laughing as she went down the stair, at some odd
saying of Bess Hall's that her father had got hold of. When
they went outside she linked her arm within that of her
friend, and nodded to this or the other passer-by, and had
a merry or a pleasant word for them, accordingly as they
greeted her. And</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Green sleeves was all my joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green sleeves was my delight,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">came naturally into her idle brain; for the day seemed a
fit one for holiday-making; the skies were clear, with large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>white clouds moving slowly across the blue; and there
was a fair west wind to stir the leaves of the trees and
the bushes, and to touch warmly and softly her pink-hued
cheek and pearly neck.</p>

<p>"Ah, me," said she, in mock desolation, "why should
one go nowadays to Shottery? What use is in't, sweet
Prue, when all the magic and enticement is gone from it?
Aforetime I had the chance of meeting with so gracious a
young gentleman, that brought news of the King's court,
and spoke so soft you would think the cuckoo in the woods
was still to listen. That was something to expect when
one had walked so far&mdash;the apparition&mdash;a trembling interview&mdash;and
then so civil and sweet a farewell! But now he
is gone away, I know not whither; and he has forgotten
that ever he lodged in a farm-house, like a king consorting
with shepherds; and doubtless he will not seek to return.
Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have never heard of him since, Judith?" her friend
said, with rapid look.</p>

<p>"Alas, no!" she said, in the same simulated vein. "And
sometimes I ask myself whether there ever was such a youth&mdash;whether
the world ever did produce such a courtly gentleman,
such a paragon, such a marvel of courtesy&mdash;or was
it not but a trick of the villain wizard? Think of it, good
Prue&mdash;to have been walking and talking with a ghost, with
a thing of air, and that twice, too! Is't not enough to chill
the marrow in your bones? Well, I would that all ghosts
were as gentle and mannerly; there would be less fear of
them among the Warwickshire wenches. But do you know,
good Prue," she said, suddenly altering her tone into something
of eagerness, "there is a matter of more moment
than ghosts that concerns us now. By this time, or I am
mistaken quite, there must be a goodly bulk of the new
play lying in the oaken chest; and again and again have I
tried to see whether I might dare to carry away some of
the sheets, but always there was some one to hinder. My
father, you know, has been much in the summer-house
since the business of the new twenty acres was settled; and
then again, when by chance he has gone away with the
bailiff somewhere, and I have had my eye on the place,
there was goodman Matthew on the watch, or else a maid
would come by to gather a dish of green gooseberries for
the baking, or Susan would have me seek out a ripe raspberry
or two for the child, or my mother would call to me
from the brew-house. But 'tis there, Prue, be sure; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>there will come a chance, I warrant; I will outwit the ancient
Matthew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you never bethink you, Judith, what your father
would say were he to discover?" her friend said, glancing
at her, as they walked along the highway.</p>

<p>Judith laughed, but with some heightened color.</p>

<p>"My father?" said she. "Truly, if he alone were to
discover, I should have easy penance. Were it between
himself and me, methinks there were no great harm done.
A daughter may fairly seek to know the means that has
gained for her father the commendation of so many of the
great people, and placed him in such good estate in his own
town. Marry, I fear not my father's knowing, were I to
confess to himself; but as for the others, were they to learn
of it&mdash;my mother, and Susan, and Dr. Hall, and the pious
Master Walter&mdash;I trow there might be some stormy weather
abroad. At all events, good Prue, in any such mischance,
you shall not suffer; 'tis I that will bear the blame, and all
the blame; for indeed I forced you to it, sweet mouse, and
you are as innocent of the wickedness as though you had
ne'er been born."</p>

<p>And now they were just about to leave the main road
for the foot-path leading to Shottery, when they heard the
sound of some one coming along on horseback; and turning
for a second, they found it was young Tom Quiney,
who was on a smart galloway nag, and coming at a goodly
pace. As he passed them he took off his cap, and lowered
it with formal courtesy.</p>

<p>"Give ye good-day," said he; but he scarcely looked at
them, nor did he pull up for further talk or greeting.</p>

<p>"We are in such haste to be rich nowadays," said
Judith, with a touch of scorn in her voice, as the two
maidens set forth to walk through the meadows, "that we
have scarce time to be civil to our friends."</p>

<p>But she bore away no ill-will; the day was too fine for
that. The soft west wind was tempering the heat and
stirring the leaves of the elms; red and white wild roses
were sprinkled among the dark green of the hedges;
there was a perfume of elder blossom in the air; and perhaps
also a faint scent of hay, for in the distance they
could see the mowers at work among the clover, and
could see the long sweep of the scythe. The sun lay
warm on the grass and the wild flowers around them;
there was a perfect silence but for the singing of the
birds; and now and again they could see one of the mowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>cease from his work, and a soft clinking sound told
them that he was sharpening the long, curving blade.
They did not walk quickly; it was an idle day.</p>

<p>Presently some one came up behind them and overtook
them. It was young Master Quiney, who seemed to have
changed his mind, and was now on foot.</p>

<p>"You are going over to Shottery, Prudence?" said he.</p>

<p>Prudence flushed uneasily. Why should he address her,
and have no word for Judith?</p>

<p>"Yes," said she; "Mistress Hathaway would have us
see her roses; she is right proud of them this year."</p>

<p>"'Tis a good year for roses," said he, in a matter-of-fact
way, and as if there were no restraint at all on any of the
party.</p>

<p>And then it seemed to occur to him that he ought to
account for his presence.</p>

<p>"I guessed you were going to Shottery," said he, indifferently,
and still addressing himself exclusively to Prudence;
"and I got a lad to take on the nag and meet me at the
cross-road; the short-cut through the meadows is pleasant
walking. To Mistress Hathaway's, said you? I dare
promise you will be pleased with the show; there never
was such a year for roses; and not a touch of blight anywhere,
as I have heard. And a fine season for the crops,
too; just such weather as the farmers might pray for;
Look at that field of rye over there, now&mdash;is't not a
goodly sight?"</p>

<p>He was talking with much appearance of self-possession;
it was Prudence who was embarrassed. As for
Judith, she paid no heed; she was looking before her at
the hedges and the elms, at the wild flowers around, and
at the field of bearded rye that bent in rustling gray-green
undulations before the westerly breeze.</p>

<p>"And how does your brother, Prudence?" he continued.
"'Tis well for him his business goes on from year to year
without respect of the seasons; he can sleep o' nights
without thinking of the weather. It is the common report
that the others of the Town Council hold him in
great regard, and will have him become alderman ere
long; is it not so?"</p>

<p>"I have heard some talk of it," Prudence said, with her
eyes cast down.</p>

<p>At this moment they happened to be passing some
patches of the common mallow that were growing by the
side of the path; and the tall and handsome youth who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>was walking with the two girls (but who never once let
his eyes stray in the direction of Judith) stooped down
and pulled one of the brightest clusters of the pale lilac
blossoms.</p>

<p>"You have no flower in your dress, Prudence," said he,
offering them to her.</p>

<p>"Nay, I care not to wear them," said she; and she
would rather have declined them, but as he still offered
them to her, how could she help accepting them and carrying
them in her hand? And then, in desperation, she
turned and addressed the perfectly silent and impassive
Judith.</p>

<p>"Judith," said she, "you might have brought the mastiff
with you for a run."</p>

<p>"Truly I might, sweetheart," said Judith, cheerfully,
"but that my grandmother likes him not in the garden;
his ways are overrough."</p>

<p>"Now that reminds me," said he, quickly (but always
addressing Prudence), "of the little spaniel-gentle that I
have. Do you know the dog, Prudence? 'Tis accounted
a great beauty, and of the true Maltese breed. Will you
accept him from me? In truth I will hold it a favor if
you will take the little creature."</p>

<p>"I?" said Prudence, with much amazement; for she
had somehow vaguely heard that the dog had been purchased
and brought to Stratford for the very purpose of
being presented to Judith.</p>

<p>"I assure you 'tis just such an one as would make a
pleasant companion for you," said he; "a gentle creature
as ever was, and affectionate too&mdash;a most pleasant and
frolicsome playfellow. Will you take it, Prudence? for
what can I do with the little beast? I have no one to look
after it."</p>

<p>"I had thought you meant Judith to have the spaniel,"
said she, simply.</p>

<p>"Nay, how would that do, sweetheart?" said Judith,
calmly. "Do you think the Don would brook such invasion
of his domain? Would you have the little thing
killed? You should take it, good cousin; 'twill be company
for you should you be alone in the house."</p>

<p>She had spoken quite as if she had been engaged in the
conversation all the way through; there was no appearance
of anger or resentment at his ostentatious ignoring
of her presence: whatever she felt she was too proud to
show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>"Then you will take the dog, Prudence," said he. "I
know I could not give it into gentler hands, for you could
not but show it kindness, as you show to all."</p>

<p>"Give ye good thanks," said Prudence, with her pale
face flushing with renewed embarrassment, "for the offer
of the gift; but in truth I doubt if it be right and seemly
to waste such care on a dumb animal when there be so
many of our fellow-creatures that have more pressing
claims on us. And there are enough of temptations to
idleness without our wilfully adding to them. But I
thank you for the intention of your kindness&mdash;indeed I
do."</p>

<p>"Nay, now, you shall have it, good Prudence, whether
you will or no," said he with a laugh. "You shall bear
with the little dog but for a week, that I beg of you; and
then if it please you not, if you find no amusement in its
tricks and antics, I will take it back again. 'Tis a bargain;
but as to your sending of it back, I have no fears; I warrant
you 'twill overcome your scruples, for 'tis a most
cunning and crafty playfellow, and merry withal; nor
will it hinder you from being as kind and helpful to those
around you as you have ever been. I envy the dog that
is to have so gentle a guardian."</p>

<p>They were now come to a parting of the ways; and he
said he would turn off to the left, so as to reach the lane
at the end of which his nag was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"And with your leave, Prudence," said he, "I will
bring the little spaniel to your house this evening, for I
am only going now as far as Bidford; and if your brother
be at home he may have half an hour to spare, that we
may have a chat about the Corporation, and the new ordinances
they propose to make. And so fare you well,
and good wishes go with you!"</p>

<p>And with that he departed, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>"Oh, Judith," Prudence exclaimed, almost melting into
tears, "my heart is heavy to see it!"</p>

<p>"What, then, good cousin?" said Judith, lightly.</p>

<p>"The quarrel."</p>

<p>"The quarrel, dear heart! Think of no such thing.
In sober truth, dear Prudence, I would not have matters
other than they are; I would not; I am well content;
and as for Master Quiney, is not he improved? Did ever
mortal hear him speak so fair before? Marry, he hath
been learning good manners, and profited well. But
there it is; you are so gentle, sweetheart, that every one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>no matter who, must find you good company; while I am
fractious, and ill to bear with; and do I marvel to see any
one prefer your smooth ways and even disposition? And
when he comes to-night, heed you, you must thank him
right civilly for bringing you the little spaniel; 'tis a great
favor; the dog is one of value that many would prize&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot take it&mdash;I will not have it. 'Twas meant for
you, Judith, as well you know," the other cried, in real
distress.</p>

<p>"But you must and shall accept the gift," her friend
said, with decision. "Ay, and show yourself grateful for
his having singled you out withal. Neither himself nor
his spaniel would go long a-begging in Stratford, I warrant
you; give him friendly welcome, sweetheart."</p>

<p>"He went away without a word to you, Judith."</p>

<p>"I am content."</p>

<p>"But why should it be thus?" Prudence said, almost
piteously.</p>

<p>"Why? Dear mouse, I have told you. He and I
never did agree; 'twas ever something wrong on one side
or the other; and wherefore should not he look around
for a gentler companion? 'Twere a wonder should he do
aught else; and now he hath shown more wisdom than
ever I laid to his credit."</p>

<p>"But the ungraciousness of his going, Judith," said the
gentle Prudence, who could in no wise understand the
apparent coolness with which Judith seemed to regard
the desperate thing that had taken place.</p>

<p>"Heaven have mercy! why should that trouble you if
it harm not me?" was the instant answer. "My spirits
are not like to be dashed down for want of a 'fare you
well.' In good sooth, he had given you so much of his
courtesy and fair speeches that perchance he had none to
spare for others."</p>

<p>By this time they were come to the little wooden gate
leading into the garden; and it was no wonder they
should pause in passing through that to regard the bewildering
and glowing luxuriance of foliage and blossom,
though this was but a cottage inclosure, and none of the
largest. The air seemed filled with the perfume of this
summer abundance; and the clear sunlight shone on the
various masses of color&mdash;roses red and white, pansies,
snapdragon, none-so-pretty, sweet-williams of every kind,
to say nothing of the clustering honeysuckle that surrounded
the cottage door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>"Was't not worth the trouble, sweetheart?" Judith said.
"Indeed, the good dame does well to be proud of such a
pageant."</p>

<p>As she spoke her grandmother suddenly made her appearance,
glancing sharply from one to the other of
them.</p>

<p>"Welcome, child, welcome," she said, "and to you,
sweet Mistress Shawe."</p>

<p>And yet she did not ask them to enter the cottage; there
was some kind of hesitation about the old dame's manner
that was unusual.</p>

<p>"Well, grandmother," said Judith, gayly, "have you no
grumbling? My cap I made myself; then must it be out
of fashion. Or I did not make it myself; then it must
have cost a mint of money. Or what say you to my petticoat&mdash;does
not the color offend you? Shall I ever attain
to the pleasing of you, think you, good grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Wench, wench, hold your peace!" the old dame said,
in a lower voice. "There is one within that may not like
the noise of strangers&mdash;though he be no stranger to you,
as he says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, grandmother?" Judith exclaimed, and involuntarily
she shrank back a little, so startled was she. "A
stranger? In the cottage? You do not mean the young
gentleman that is in hiding&mdash;that I met in the lane&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The same, Judith, the same," she said, quickly; "and
I know not whether he would wish to be seen by more
than needs be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She glanced at Judith, who understood: moreover, the
latter had pulled together her courage again.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, good grandmother," said she; and she
turned to Prudence. "You hear, good Prue, who is
within."</p>

<p>"Yes," the other answered, but somewhat breathless.</p>

<p>"Now, then, is such an opportunity as may ne'er occur
again," Judith said. "You will come with me, good Prue?
Nay, but you must."</p>

<p>"Indeed I shall not!" Prudence exclaimed, stepping
back in affright. "Not for worlds, Judith, would I have
aught to do with such a thing. And you, Judith, for my
sake, come away! We will go back to Stratford!&mdash;we will
look at the garden some other time!&mdash;in truth, I can see
your grandmother is of my mind too. Judith, for the
love of me, come!&mdash;let us get away from this place!"</p>

<p>Judith regarded her with a strange kind of smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>"I have had such courtesy and fair manners shown me
to-day, sweet Prue," said she, with a sort of gracious calmness,
"that I am fain to seek elsewhere for some other
treatment, lest I should grow vain. Will it please you
wait for me in the garden, then? Grandmother, I am
going in with you to help you give your guest good welcome."</p>

<p>"Judith!" the terrified Prudence exclaimed, in a kind
of despair.</p>

<p>But Judith, with her head erect, and with a perfect and
proud self-possession, had followed her grandmother into
the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A HERALD MERCURY.</h3>

<p>The distance between this luxuriant garden, all radiant
and glowing in light and color, and the small and darkened
inner room of the cottage, was but a matter of a few
yards; yet in that brief space, so alert was her brain, she
had time to reconsider much. And with her, pride or
anger was always of short duration, the sunny cheerfulness
of her nature refusing to harbor such uncongenial
guests. Why, she asked herself, should she take umbrage
at the somewhat too open neglect that had just been
shown her? Was it not tending in the very direction she
had herself desired? Had she not begged and prayed
him to give Prudence the little spaniel-gentle? Nay,
had she not wilfully gone and buried in the church-yard
the bit of rosemary that he had sent her to keep, putting
it away from her with the chance of it summoning an unknown
lover? So now, she said to herself, she would
presently come out again to the poor affrighted Prudence,
and would reassure her, and congratulate her, moreover,
with words of good cheer and comfort for the future.</p>

<p>And then again, in this lightning-like survey of the
situation, she was conscious that she was becomingly
dressed&mdash;and right glad indeed that she had chanced to
put on the gray velvet cap with the brass beads and the
curling feather; and she knew that the young gentleman
would be courteous and civil, with admiring eyes. Moreover,
she had a vague impression that he was somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>too much given to speak of Ben Jonson; and she hoped
for some opportunity to let him understand that her father
was one of good estate, and much thought of by every
one around, whose daughter knew what was due to his
position, and could conduct herself not at all as a country
wench. And so it was that the next minute found her in
the twilight of the room; and there, truly enough, he was,
standing at the small window.</p>

<p>"Give ye good welcome sir," said she.</p>

<p>"What! fair Mistress Judith?" he said, as he quickly
turned round. And he would have come forward and
kissed her hand, perchance, but that a moment's hesitation
prevented him.</p>

<p>"It may be that I have offended you," said he, diffidently.</p>

<p>"In what, good sir?"</p>

<p>She was quite at her ease; the little touch of modest
color in her face could scarcely be attributed to rustic
shyness; it was but natural; and it added to the gentleness
of her look.</p>

<p>"Nay, then, sweet lady, 'twas but a lack of courage that
I would ask you to pardon," said he&mdash;though he did not
seem conscious of heavy guilt, to judge by the way in
which his black and eloquent eyes regarded Judith's face
and the prettinesses of her costume. "There was a promise
that I should communicate with you if I returned to
this part of the country; but I found myself not bold
enough to take advantage of your kindness. However,
fortune has been my friend, since again I meet you; 'tis
the luckiest chance; I but asked your good grandmother
here for a cup of water as I passed, and she would have me
take a cup of milk instead; and then she bade me to come
in out of the heat for a space&mdash;which I was nothing loath to
do, as you may guess; and here have I been taking up the
good lady's time with I know not what of idle gossip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But sit ye down, grandchild," the good dame said;
"and you, sir, pray sit you down. Here, wench," she
called to the little maid that was her sole domestic; "go
fill this jug from the best barrel."</p>

<p>And then she herself proceeded to get down from the
high wooden rail some of the pewter trenchers that shone
there like a row of white moons in the dusk; and these
she placed on the table, with one or two knives; and then
she began to get forth cakes, a cheese, a ham, some spiced
bread, the half of a cold gooseberry-tart, and what not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>"'Tis not every day we come by a visitor in these quiet
parts," said she&mdash;"ay, good sir, and one that is not afraid
to speak out his mind. Nay, nay, grandchild, I tell thee
sit thee down; thou art too fine a madam this morning to
meddle wi' kitchen matters. Tell the gentleman I be
rather deaf; but I thank him for his good company. Sit
ye down, sweeting; sooth, you look bravely this morning."</p>

<p>"Have I pleased you at last, grandmother?&mdash;'tis a miracle,
surely," she said, with a smile; and then she turned
gravely to entertain the old dame's visitor. "I hope your
fortunes have mended, sir," said she.</p>

<p>"In a measure&mdash;somewhat; but still I am forced to take
heed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perchance you have still the letter to my father?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, madam, I considered it a prudent thing to destroy
it&mdash;little as that was in my heart."</p>

<p>"I had thought on your next coming to the neighborhood
that you would have taken the chance to make my
father's friendship," said she, and not without some secret
disappointment; for she was anxious that this acquaintance
of Ben Jonson's should see the New Place, with all its tapestries,
and carved wood, and silver-gilt bowls; with its
large fair garden, too, and substantial barns and stables.
Perhaps she would have had him carry the tale to London?
There were some things (she considered) quite as fine as
the trumpery masques and mummeries of the court that
the London people seemed to talk about. She would have
liked him to see her father at the head of his own table,
with her mother's napery shining, and plenty of good
friends round the board, and her father drinking to the
health of Bess Hall out of the silver-topped tankard that
Thomas Combe, and Russell, and Sadler, and Julius Shawe,
and the rest of them, had given him on his last birthday.
Or perchance she would have had him see her father riding
through the town of Stratford with some of these good
neighbors (and who the handsomest of all the company?
she would make bold to ask), with this one and that praising
the Evesham roan, and the wagoners as they passed
touching their caps to "worthy Mahster Shacksper." Ben
Jonson! Well, she had seen Ben Jonson. There was not
a maid in the town would have looked his way. Whereas,
if there were any secret enchantments going forward on
Hallowmas-eve (and she knew of such, if the ministers did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>not), and if the young damsels were called on to form a
shape in their brain as they prayed for the handsome lover
that was to be sent them in the future, she was well aware
what type of man they would choose from amongst those
familiar to them; and also it had more than once reached
her ears that the young fellows would jokingly say among
themselves that right well it was that Master Shakespeare
was married and in safe-keeping, else they would never
have a chance. In the meanwhile, and with much courtesy,
this young gentleman was endeavoring to explain to
her why it was he dared not go near Stratford town.</p>

<p>"Truly, sweet Mistress Judith," said he, in his suave
voice, and with modestly downcast eyes, "it is a disappointment
to me in more regards than one; perchance I
dare not say how much. But in these times one has to see
that one's own misfortunes may not prove harmful to one's
friends; and then again, ever since the French King's murder,
they are becoming harder and harder against any one,
however innocent he may be, that is under suspicion. And
whom do they not suspect? The Parliament have entreated
the King to be more careful of his safety; and the
recusants&mdash;as they call those that have some regard for
the faith they were brought up in&mdash;must not appear within
ten miles of the court. Nay, they are ordered to betake
themselves to their own dwellings; and by the last proclamation
all Roman priests, Jesuits, and seminaries are banished
the kingdom. I wonder not your good grandmother
should have a word of pity for them that are harried this
way and that for conscience' sake."</p>

<p>"I say naught, I say naught; 'twere well to keep a still
tongue," the old dame said, being still busy with the table.
"But I have heard there wur more peace and quiet in
former days when there wur but one faith in the land; ay,
and good tending of the poor folk by the monks and the
rich houses."</p>

<p>However, the chance reference to the French King had
suddenly recalled to Judith that Prudence was waiting her
in the garden; and her conscience smote her for her neglect;
while she was determined that so favorable an opportunity
should not be lost of banishing once and forever
her dear gossip's cruel suspicions. So she rose.</p>

<p>"I crave your pardon, good sir," said she, "if I leave
you for a moment to seek my gossip Prudence Shawe, that
was to wait for me in the garden. I would have you acquainted
with each other; but pray you, sir, forbear to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>anything against the Puritan section of the church, for she
is well inclined that way, and she has a heart that is easily
wounded."</p>

<p>"And thank you for the caution, fair Mistress Judith,"
said he; and he rose, and bowed low, and stood hat in
hand until she had left the apartment.</p>

<p>At first, so blinding was the glare of light and color,
she could hardly see; but presently, when her eyes were
less dazzled, she looked everywhere, and found the garden
quite empty. She called; there was no answer. She
went down to the little gate; there was no one in the
road. And so, taking it for granted that Prudence had
sought safety in flight, and was now back in Stratford
town, or on the way thither, she returned into the cottage
with a light heart, and well content to hear what news
was abroad.</p>

<p>"Pray you, sir," said old Mistress Hathaway, "sit in to
the table; and you, grandchild, come your ways. If the
fare be poor, the welcome is hearty. What, then, Judith?
Dined already, sayst thou? Body o' me, a fresh-colored
young wench like you should be ready for your dinner at
any time. Well, well, sit thee in, and grace the table; and
you shall sip a cup of claret for the sake of good company."</p>

<p>Master Leofric Hope, on the other hand, was not at all
backward in applying himself to this extemporized meal;
on the contrary, he did it such justice as fairly warmed the
old dame's heart. And he drank to her, moreover, bending
low over his cup of ale; but he did not do the like by
Judith&mdash;for some reason or another. And all the while he
was telling them of the affairs of the town; as to how there
was much talking of the new river that was to bring water
from some ten or twelve miles off, and how one Middleton
was far advanced with the cutting of it, although many
were against it, and would have the project overthrown
altogether. Of these and similar matters he spoke right
pleasantly, and the old dame was greatly interested; but
Judith grew to think it strange that so much should be
said about public affairs, and what the people were talking
about, and yet no mention made of her father. And so it
came about, when he went on to tell them of the new ship
of war that so many were going to see at Woolwich, and
that the King made so much of, she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my father knows all about that ship. 'Twas but
the other day I heard him and Master Combe speak of it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>and of the King too; and my father said, 'Poor man, 'tis
a far smaller ship than that he will make his last voyage
in.'"</p>

<p>"Said he that of the King?"</p>

<p>She looked up in quick alarm.</p>

<p>"But as he would have said it of me, or of you, or of
any one," she exclaimed. "Nay, my father is well inclined
toward the King, though he be not as much at the court
as some, nor caring to make pageants for the court ladies
and their attendants and followers."</p>

<p>If there were any sarcasm in this speech, he did not
perceive it; for it merely led him on to speak of the new
masque that Ben Jonson was preparing for the Prince
Henry; and incidentally he mentioned that the subject
was to be Oberon, the Fairy Prince.</p>

<p>"Oberon?" said Judith, opening her eyes. "Why, my
father hath writ about that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, as we all know," said he, courteously; "but
there will be a difference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A difference?" said she. "By my life, yes! There
will be a difference. I wonder that Master Jonson was
not better advised."</p>

<p>"Nay, in this matter, good Mistress Judith," said he,
"there will be no comparison. I know 'tis the fashion to
compare them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To compare my father and Master Jonson?" she said,
as if she had not heard aright. "Why, what comparison?
In what way? Pray you remember, sir, I have seen Master
Ben Jonson. I have seen him, and spoken with him.
And as for my father, I'll be bound there is not his fellow
for a handsome presence and gracious manners in all Warwickshire&mdash;no,
nor in London town neither, I'll be sworn!"</p>

<p>"I meant not that, sweet lady," said he, with a smile;
and he added, grimly: "I grant you our Ben looks as if
he had been in the wars; he hath had a tussle with Bacchus
on many a merry night, and bears the scars of these
noble combats. No; 'tis the fashion to compare them as
wits&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd as lief compare them as men, good sir," said she,
with a touch of pride; "and I know right well which
should have my choice."</p>

<p>"When it is my good fortune, dear lady," said the young
man, "to have Master William Shakespeare's daughter
sitting before me, I need no other testimony to his grace
and bearing, even had I never set eyes on him." And with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>that he bowed low; and there was a slight flush on her
face that was none of displeasure; while the old dame
said:</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, there be many a wench in Warwickshire worse
favored than she. Pray Heaven it turn not her head! The
wench is a good wench, but ill to manage; and 'twere no
marvel if the young men got tired of waiting."</p>

<p>To escape from any further discussion of this subject,
Judith proposed that they should go out and look at her
grandmother's roses and pansies, which was in truth the
object of her visit; and she added that if Master Hope
(this was the first time she had named him by his name)
were still desirous of avoiding observation, they could go
to the little bower at the upper hedge-row, which was
sufficiently screened from the view of any passer-by. The
old dame was right willing, for she was exceedingly proud
of this garden, that had no other tending than her own;
and so she got her knitting-needles and ball of wool, and
preceded them out into the warm air and the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear me," said she, stopping to regard two small
shrubs that stood withered and brown by the side of the
path. "There be something strange in that rosemary, now;
in good sooth there be. Try as I may, I cannot bring
them along; the spring frost makes sure to kill them."
And then she went on again.</p>

<p>"Strange, indeed," said the young man to his companion,
these two being somewhat behind, "that a plant that is so
fickle and difficult to hold should be the emblem of constancy."</p>

<p>"I know not what they do elsewhere," said Judith, carelessly
pulling a withered leaf or two to see if they were
quite inodorous, "but hereabouts they often use a bit of
rosemary for a charm, and the summoning of spirits."</p>

<p>He started somewhat, and glanced at her quickly and
curiously. But there was clearly no subtle intention in the
speech. She idly threw away the leaves.</p>

<p>"Have you faith in such charms, Mistress Judith?" said
he, still regarding her.</p>

<p>"In truth I know not," she answered, as if the question
were of but little moment. "There be some who believe
in them, and others that laugh. But strange stories are
told; marry, there be some of them that are not pleasant
to hear of a winter's night, when one has to change the
warm chimney-corner for the cold room above. There is
my grandmother, she hath a rare store of them; but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>fit not well with the summer-time and with such a show as
this."</p>

<p>"A goodly show, indeed," said he; and by this time they
were come to a small arbor of rude lattice-work mostly
smothered in foliage; and there was a seat within it, and
also a tiny table; while in front they were screened from
the gaze of any one going along the road by a straggling
and propped-up wall of peas that were now showing their
large white blossoms plentifully among the green.</p>

<p>"'Tis a quiet spot," said he, when they were seated, and
the old dame had taken to her knitting; "'tis enough to
make one pray never to hear more of the din and turmoil
of London."</p>

<p>"I should have thought, sir," said Judith, "you would
have feared to go near London, if there be those that would
fain get to know of your whereabout."</p>

<p>"Truly," said he, "I have no choice. I must run the
risk. From time to time I must seek to see whether the
cloud that is hanging over me give signs of breaking. And
surely such must now be the case, when fortune hath been
so kind to me as to place me where I am at this moment&mdash;in
such company&mdash;with such a quiet around. 'Tis like the
work of a magician; though from time to time I remind
me that I should rise and leave, craving your pardon for
intruding on you withal."</p>

<p>"Trouble not yourself, young sir," the old dame said, in
her matter-of-fact way, as she looked up from her knitting;
"if the place content you, 'tis right well; we be in no such
hurry in these country parts; we let the day go by as it
lists, and thank God for a sound night's rest at the end of
it."</p>

<p>"And you have a more peaceful and happy life than the
London citizens, I'll be bound," said he, "with all their
feasts and gayeties and the noise of drums and the like."</p>

<p>"We hear but the murmur of such things from a far
distance," Judith said. "Was there not a great to-do on the
river when the citizens gave their welcome to the Prince?"</p>

<p>"Why, there, now," said he, brightening up at this
chance of repaying in some measure the courtesy of his
entertainers; "there was as wonderful a thing as London
ever saw. A noble spectacle, truly; for the Companies
would not be outdone; and such bravery of apparel, and
such a banqueting in the afternoon! And perchance you
heard of it but through some news-letter! Shall I tell you
what I saw on my own part?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>"If it be not too troublesome to you, good sir."</p>

<p>He was glad enough; for he had noticed, when he was
describing such things, that Judith's eyes grew absent, and
he could gaze at them without fear of causing her to start
and blush. Moreover, it was a pretty face to tell a story to;
and the day was so still and shining; and all around them
there was a scent of roses in the air.</p>

<p>"Why, it was about daybreak, as I should think," he said,
"that the citizens began to come forth; and a bright fair
morning it was; and all of them in their best array. And
you may be sure that when the Companies learned that the
whole of the citizens were minded to show their love for
the Prince Henry on his coming back from Richmond,
they were not like to be behindhand; and such preparations
had been made as you would scarce believe. Well,
then, so active were they in their several ways that by eight
of the clock the Companies were all assembled in their
barges of state to wait the Lord Mayor and Aldermen;
and such a sound of drums and trumpets and fifes was
there; and the water covered with the fleet, and the banks
all crowded with them that had come down to see. Then
the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen being arrived, the great
procession set forth in state; and such a booming of cannon
there was, and cheering from the crowd. 'Twas a
sight, on my life; for they bore the pageant with them&mdash;that
was a huge whale and a dolphin; and on the whale
sat a fair and lovely nymph, Corinea she was called, the
Queen of Cornwall; and she had a coronet of strange sea-shells,
and strings of pearls around her neck and on her
wrists; and her dress was of crimson silk, so that all could
make her out from a distance; and she had a silver shield
slung on to her left arm, and in her right hand a silver
spear&mdash;oh, a wonderful sight she was; I marvel not the
crowd cheered and cheered again. Then on the other animal&mdash;that
is, the dolphin&mdash;sat one that represented Amphion&mdash;he
was the father of music, as you must know; and
a long beard he wore, and he also had a wreath of sea-shells
on his head, and in his hand a harp of gold that shone in
the sun. Well, away they set toward Chelsea; and there
they waited for the Prince's approach&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the young Prince himself," Judith said, quickly
and eagerly; "he bears himself well, does he not? He
bears himself like a prince? He would match such a pageant
right royally, is't not so?"</p>

<p>"Why, he is the very model and mirror of princehood!&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>pink of chivalry!&mdash;nor is there one of them at the
court that can match him at the knightly exercises," said
this enthusiastic chronicler, who had his reward in seeing
how interested she was. "Well, when the young Prince
was come to Chelsea, there he paused; and the Queen
Corinea addressed him in a speech of welcome&mdash;truly, I
could not hear a word of it, there was such a noise among
the multitude; but I was told thereafter that it presented
him with their love and loyal duty; and then they all set
forth toward Whitehall again. By this time 'twas late in
the day; and no man would have believed so many dwelt
in the neighborhood of our great river; and that again was
as naught to the crowd assembled when they were come
again to the town. And here&mdash;as it must have been arranged
beforehand, doubtless&mdash;the fleet of barges separated
and formed two long lines, so as to make a lane for
the Prince to pass through, with great cheering and shouting,
so that when they were come to the court steps, he
was at the head of them all. And now it was that the dolphin
approached, and Amphion, that was riding on his
back, bid the Prince a loyal farewell in the name of all the
citizens; and at the end of the speech&mdash;which, in truth
the people guessed at rather than heard&mdash;there was such
a tumult of huzzas, and a firing of cannon, and the drums
and the trumpets sounding, and on every hand you could
hear nothing but 'Long live our Prince of Wales, the
Royal Henry!'"</p>

<p>"And he bore himself bravely, I'll dare be sworn!" she
exclaimed. "I have heard my father speak of him; he is
one that will uphold the honor of England when he comes
to the throne!"</p>

<p>"And there was such a feasting and rejoicing that evening,"
he continued, "within doors and without; and many
an honest man, I fear me, transgressed, and laid the train
for a sore-distracted head next day. Then 'twas some two
or three evenings after that, if I remember aright, that we
had the great water-fight and the fire-works; but perchance
you heard of these, sweet Mistress Judith?"</p>

<p>"In truth, good sir," she answered, "I heard of these,
as of the welcome you speak of, but in so scant a way as
to be worth naught. 'Tis not a kind of talking that is encouraged
at our house; unless, indeed, when Julius Shawe
and Master Combe and some of them come in of an evening
to chat with my father; and then sometimes I contrive
to linger, with the bringing in of a flagon of Rhenish or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>the like, unless I am chid and sent forth. I pray you,
good sir, if I do not outwear your patience, to tell us of
the water-fight, too."</p>

<p>"'Tis I that am more like to outwear your patience, fair
Judith," said he. "I would I had a hundred fights to tell
you of. But this one&mdash;well, 'twas a goodly pageant; and
a vast crowd was come down to the water's edge to see
what was going forward, for most of the business of the
day was over, and both master and 'prentice were free.
And very soon we saw how the story was going; for there
was a Turkish pirate, with fierce men with blackened faces;
and they would plunder two English merchantmen and
make slaves of the crews. This was but the beginning of
the fight; and there was great firing of guns and man&#339;uvring
of the vessels; and the merchantmen were like to fare
badly, not being trained to arms like the pirate. In sooth
they were sore bestead; but presently up came two ships
of war to rescue; and then the coil began in good earnest,
I warrant you; for there was boarding and charging and
clambering over the bulwarks&mdash;ay, and many a man on
both sides knocked into the sea; until in the end they had
killed or secured all the pirates, and then there was naught
to do but to blow up the pirate ship into the air, with a
noise like thunder, and scarce a rag or spar of him remaining.
'Twas a right good ending, I take it, in the minds of
the worthy citizens; doubtless they hoped that every Turkish
rogue would be served the like. And then it was that
the blowing up of the pirate ship was a kind of signal for
the beginning of the fire-works; and it had grown to dusk
now, so that the blazes of red light and blue light and the
whizzing of the squibs and what not seemed to fill all the
air. 'Twas a rare climax to the destruction of the Turks;
and the people cheered and cheered again when 'twas well
done; and then at the end came a great discharge of guns
and squibs and showers of stars, that one would have
thought the whole world was on fire. Sure I am that the
waters of the Thames never saw such a sight before. And
the people went home right well content, and I doubt not
drank to the confusion of all pirates, as well as to the health
of the young Prince, that is to preserve the realm to us in
years to come."</p>

<p>They talked for some time thereafter about that and
other matters, and about his own condition and occupations
at the farm; and then he rose, and there was a smile
on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>"You know, fair Mistress Judith," said he, "that a wise
man is careful not to out-stay his welcome, lest it be not
offered to him again; and your good grandmother has afforded
me so pleasant an hour's gossip and good company
that I would fain look forward to some other chance of <span class="err" title="original: the the">the</span>
same in the future."</p>

<p>"Must you go, good sir?" said Judith, also rising. "I
trust we have not over-taxed your patience. We country
folk are hungry listeners."</p>

<p>"To have been awarded so much of your time, sweet
Mistress Judith," said he, bowing very low, "is an honor
I am not likely to forget."</p>

<p>And then he addressed the old dame, who had missed
something of this.</p>

<p>"Give ye good thanks for your kindness, good Mistress
Hathaway," said he.</p>

<p>"Good fortune attend ye, sir," said the old dame, contentedly,
and without ceasing from her knitting.</p>

<p>Judith was standing there, with her eyes cast down.</p>

<p>"Sweet lady, by your leave," said he, and he took her
hand and raised it and just touched her fingers with his
lips. Then he bowed low again, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Fare you well, good sir," Judith had said at the same
moment, but without any word as to a future meeting.
Then she returned into the little arbor and sat down.</p>

<p>"Is't not like a meteor, grandmother, shooting across
the sky?" said she, merrily. "Beshrew me, but the day
has grown dark since he left! Didst ever hear of such a
gallymawfrey of dolphins and whales, and prince's barges,
and the roaring of cannon, and fire-works? Sure 'tis well
we live in the country quiet, our ears would be riven in
twain else. And you, grandmother, that was ever preaching
about prudent behavior, to be harboring one that may
be an outlaw&mdash;a recusant; perchance he hath drawn his
sword in the King's presence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What know you of the young gentleman, Judith?"
the old dame said, sharply.</p>

<p>"Marry, not a jot beyond what he hath doubtless told
to yourself, good grandmother. But see you any harm
in him? Have you suspicion of him? Would you have
me think&mdash;as Prudence would fain believe&mdash;that there is
witchcraft about him?"</p>

<p>"Truly I see no harm in the young gentleman," the old
grandmother was constrained to say. "And he be fair-spoken,
and modest withal. But look you to this, wench,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>should you chance to meet him again while he bideth here
in this neighborhood&mdash;I trow 'twere better you did not&mdash;but
should that chance, see you keep a still tongue in your
head about Church and King and Parliament. Let others
meddle who choose; 'tis none of your affairs: do you hear
me, child? These be parlous times, as the talk is; they
do well that keep the by-ways, and let my lord's coaches
go whither they list."</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said Judith, gravely, "I know there be
many things in which I cannot please you, but this sin
that you would lay to my charge&mdash;nay, dear grandam, when
have you caught me talking about Church and King and
Parliament? Truly I wish them well; but I am content
if they go their own way."</p>

<p>The old dame glanced at her, to see what this demure
tone of speech meant.</p>

<p>"Thou?" she said, in a sort of grumble. "Thy brain
be filled with other gear, I reckon. 'Tis a bit of ribbon that
hath hold of thee; or the report as to which of the lads
shot best at the match; or perchance 'tis the purchase of
some penny ballads, that you may put the pictures on your
chamber wall, as if you were a farm wench just come in
from the milking pail."</p>

<p>"Heaven have pity on me, good grandmother," said she,
with much penitence, and she looked down at her costume,
"but I can find no way of pleasing you. You scold me for
being but a farm wench; and truly this petticoat, though
it be pretty enough, methinks might have been made of a
costlier stuff; and my cap&mdash;good grandmother, look at my
cap&mdash;"</p>

<p>She took it off, and smoothed the gray velvet of it, and
arranged the beads and the feather.</p>

<p>"&mdash;is the cap also too much of the fashion of a farm
wench? or have I gone amiss the other way, and become
too like a city dame? Would that I knew how to please
you, grandam!"</p>

<p>"Go thy ways, child; get thee home!" the old woman
said, but only half angrily. "Thy foolish head hath been
turned by hearing of those court gambols. Get you to
your needle; be your mother's napery all so well mended
that you can spend the whole day in idleness?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but you are in the right there, good grandmother,"
said Judith, drawing closer to her, and taking
her thin and wrinkled hand in her own warm, white, soft
ones. "But not to the needle&mdash;not to the needle, good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>grandam; I have other eggs on the spit. Did not I tell
you of the Portugal receipts that Prudence got for me?&mdash;in
good sooth I did; well, the dishes were made; and next
day at dinner my father was right well pleased. 'Tis little
heed he pays to such matters; and we scarce thought of
asking him how he liked the fare, when all at once he said:
'Good mother, you must give my thanks to Jane cook;
'twill cheer her in her work; nay, I owe them.' Then says
my mother: 'But these two dishes were not prepared by
the cook, good husband; 'twas one of the maids.' 'One
of the maids?' he says. 'Well, which one of the maids?
Truly, 'tis something rare to be found in a country house.'
And then there was a laughing amongst all of them; and
he fixes his eyes on me. 'What?' he says, 'that saucy
wench? Is she striving to win her a husband at last?'
And so you see, good grandmother, I must waste no more
time here, for Prudence hath one or two more of these receipts;
and I must try them to see whether my father approves
or not."</p>

<p>And so she kissed the old dame, and bade her farewell,
refusing at the same time to have the escort of the small
maid across the meadows to the town.</p>

<p>All the temporary annoyance of the morning was now
over and forgotten; she was wholly pleased to have had
this interview, and to have heard minutely of all the great
doings in London. She walked quickly; a careless gladness
shone in her face; and she was lightly singing to herself,
as she went along the well-beaten path through the
fields,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men were deceivers ever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">But it was not in the nature of any complaint against the
inconstancy of man that this rhyme had come into her
head. Quite other thoughts came as well. At one moment
she was saying to herself:</p>

<p>"Why, now, have I no spaniel-gentle with me to keep
me company?"</p>

<p>And then the next minute she was saying with a sort of
laugh:</p>

<p>"God help me, I fear I am none of the spaniel-gentle
kind!"</p>

<p>But there was no deep smiting of conscience even when
she confessed so much. Her face was radiant and content;
she looked at the cattle, or the trees, or the children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>as it chanced, as if she knew them all, and knew that they
were friendly toward her; and then again the idle air
would come into her brain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sigh not so, but let them go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And be you blithe and bonny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Converting all your sounds of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into hey, nonny, nonny!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>A TIRE-WOMAN.</h3>

<p>It was not until after supper that evening that Judith
was free to seek out her companion, who had fled from
her in the morning; and when she did steal forth&mdash;carrying
a small basket in her hand&mdash;she approached the house
with much more caution than was habitual with her.
She glanced in at the lower windows, but could see
nothing. Then, instead of trying whether the latch was
left loose, she formally knocked at the door.</p>

<p>It was opened by a little rosy-cheeked girl of eleven or
twelve, who instantly bobbed a respectful courtesy.</p>

<p>"Is Mistress Prudence within, little Margery?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, if it please you," said the little wench, and she
stood aside to let Judith pass.</p>

<p>But Judith did not enter; she seemed listening.</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"In her own chamber, if it please you."</p>

<p>"Alone, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it please you, Mistress Judith."</p>

<p>Judith patted the little maid in requital of her courtesy,
and then stole noiselessly up-stairs. The door was open.
Prudence was standing before a small table ironing a pair
of snow-white cuffs, the while she was repeating to herself
verses of a psalm. Her voice, low as it was, could be
heard distinctly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Open thou my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>

<p>For thou desirest no sacrifice, though I would give it; thou delightest
not in burnt-offering.</p>

<p>The sacrifices of God are a contrite spirit; a contrite and a broken
heart, O God, thou will not despise.</p>

<p>Be favorable unto Zion for thy good pleasure; build the walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Then shalt thou accept the sacrifices of righteousness, even the burnt
offering and oblation; then shall they offer calves upon thine altar.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>She happened to turn her head; and then she uttered a
slight cry of surprise, and came quickly to Judith, and
caught her by the hand.</p>

<p>"What said he?" she exclaimed, almost breathlessly.
"You saw him? 'Twas the same, was it not? How came
he there? Judith, tell me!"</p>

<p>"You timid mouse that ran away!" the other said, with
a complacent smile. "Why, what should he say? But
prithee go on with the cuffs, else the iron will be cold.
And are you alone in the house, Prudence? There is no
one below?"</p>

<p>"None but the maids, I trow; or Julius, perchance, if
he be come in from the malt-house."</p>

<p>"Quick, then, with the cuffs," Judith said, "and get
them finished. Nay, I will tell thee all about the young
gentleman thereafter. Get thee finished with the cuffs, and
put them on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I meant them not for this evening, Judith," said
she, with her eyes turned away.</p>

<p>"'Tis this evening, and now, you must wear them," her
friend said, peremptorily. "And more than these. See,
I have brought you some things, dear mouse, that you must
wear for my sake&mdash;nay, nay, I will take no denial&mdash;you
must and shall&mdash;and with haste, too, must you put them
on, lest any one should come and find the mistress of the
house out of call. Is not this pretty, good Prudence?"</p>

<p>She had opened the basket and taken therefrom a plaited
ruff that the briefest feminine glance showed to be of the
finest cobweb lawn, tinged a faint saffron hue, and tied
with silken strings. Prudence, who now divined the object
of her visit, was overwhelmed with confusion. The
fair and pensive face became rose red with embarrassment,
and she did not even know how to protest.</p>

<p>"And this," said Judith, in the most matter-of-fact way,
taking something else out of the basket, "will also become
you well&mdash;nay, not so, good mouse, you shall be as
prim and Puritanical as you please to-morrow; to-night
you shall be a little braver; and is it not handsome, too?&mdash;'twas
a gift to my mother&mdash;and she knows that I have
it&mdash;though I have never worn it."</p>

<p>This second article that she held out and stroked with
her fingers was a girdle of buff-colored leather, embroidered
with flowers in silk of different colors, and having
a margin of filigree silver-work both above and below
and a broad silver clasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>"Come, then, let's try&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, Judith," the other said, retreating a step; "I cannot&mdash;indeed
I cannot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed you must, silly child!" Judith said, and she
caught hold of her angrily. "I say you shall. What
know you of such things? Must I teach you manners?"</p>

<p>And when Judith was in this authoritative mood, Prudence
had but little power to withstand her. Her face
was still burning with embarrassment, but she succumbed
in silence, while Judith whipped off the plain linen collar
that her friend wore, and set on in its stead this small but
handsome ruff. She arranged it carefully, and smoothed
Prudence's soft fair hair, and gave a finishing touch to the
three-cornered cap; then she stepped back a pace or two
to contemplate her handiwork.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed (pretending to see nothing of
Prudence's blushes). "A princess! On my life, a princess!
And now for the girdle; but you must cast aside that
housewife's pouch, sweetheart, and I will lend thee this
little pomander of mine; in truth 'twill suit it well."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear Judith!" the other said, almost piteously.
"Indeed I cannot prank me out in these borrowed
plumes. If you will have it so, I will wear the ruff; but
not the girdle&mdash;not the girdle, dear cousin&mdash;that all would
see was none of mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" Judith exclaimed, suddenly, for there
was a noise below.</p>

<p>"'Tis Julius come in from the barn," Prudence said.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us," the other cried, with a laugh, "I
thought 'twas the spaniel-gentle come already. So you
will not wear the girdle? Well, the ruff becomes you
right fairly: and&mdash;and those roses in your cheeks, good
Prue&mdash;why, what is the matter? Is there aught wonderful
in one of Julius's friends coming to see him in the
evening? And as the mistress of the house you must receive
him well and courteously; and be not so demure of
speech and distant in manner, dearest heart, for youth
must have a little merriment, and we cannot always be at
our prayers."</p>

<p>"I know not what you mean, Judith, unless it be something
that is far away from any thought or wish of
mine."</p>

<p>There was a touch of sincerity in this speech that instantly
recalled Judith from her half-gibing ways. The
truth was that while she herself was free enough in confiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>to this chosen gossip of hers all about such lovers or
would-be lovers as happened to present themselves, Prudence
had never volunteered any similar confidence in
return; and the very fact that there might be reasons for
this reticence was enough to keep Judith from seeking to
remove the veil. Judith herself was accustomed to make
merry over the whole matter of sweethearts and rhymed
messages and little tender gifts; but Prudence was sensitive,
and Judith was careful not to wound her by indiscreet
questioning. And at this moment, when Prudence was
standing there confused and abashed, some compunction
seized the heart of her friend. She took her hand.</p>

<p>"In good sooth, I meant not to tease you, sweetheart,"
said she, in a kindly way; "and if I advise you in aught,
'tis but that you should make your brother's house a pleasant
resort for them that would be friendly with him and
visit him. What harm can there be in receiving such with
a cheerful welcome, and having a pretty house-mistress,
and all things neat and comfortable? Dear mouse, you so
often lecture me that I must have my turn; and I do not
find fault or cause of quarrel; 'tis but a wish that you
would be less severe in your ways, and let your kind heart
speak more freely. Men, that have the burden of the
world's fight to bear, love to meet women-folk that have
a merry and cheerful countenance; 'twere a marvel else;
and of an evening, when there is idleness and some solace
after the labors of the day, why should one be glum, and
thinking ever of that next world that is coming soon
enough of its own accord? Look you how well the ruff
becomes you; and what sin is in it? The girdle, too; think
you my mother would have worn it had there been aught
of evil in a simple piece of leather and embroidery?"</p>

<p>"'Tis many a day since she put it aside, as I well remember,"
Prudence said, but with a smile, for she was
easily won over.</p>

<p>"Truly," said Judith, with a touch of scorn, "the good
preachers are pleased to meddle with small matters when
they would tell a woman what she should wear, and order
a maiden to give up a finger ring or a bit of lace on peril
of her losing her soul. These be marvellous small deer
to be so hunted and stormed about with bell, book, and
candle. But now, good Prudence, for this one evening, I
would have you please your visitor and entertain him;
and the spaniel-gentle&mdash;that, indeed, you must take from
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>"I cannot, dear Judith; 'twas meant for you," Prudence
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You cannot go back from your promise, good cousin,"
Judith said, coolly, and with some slight inattention to facts.
"'Twould be unmannerly of you to refuse the gift, or to
refuse ample thanks for it either. And see you have plenty
on the board, for men like good fare along with good
company; and let there be no stint of wine or ale as they
may choose, for your brother's house, Prudence, must not
be niggard, were it only for appearance' sake."</p>

<p>"But you will stay, dear Judith, will you not?" the
other said, anxiously. "In truth you can entertain them
all wherever you go; and always there is such heart in the
company&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, I cannot, sweet mouse," Judith said, lightly.
"There is much for me to do now in the evenings since
Susan has gone back to her own home. And now I must
go, lest your visitor arrive and find you unprepared: marry,
you must wear the cuffs as they are, since I have hindered
you in the ironing."</p>

<p>"But you cannot go, Judith, till you have told me what
happened to-day at the cottage," the other pleaded.</p>

<p>"What happened? Why, nothing," Judith said, brightly.
"Only that my grandmother is of a mind with myself
that a fairer-spoken young gentleman seldom comes into
these parts, and that, when he does, he should be made
welcome. Bless thy heart, hadst thou but come in and
seen how attentive the good dame was to him! And she
would press him to have some claret wine; but he said
no: perchance he guessed that good grandam had but
small store of that. Nay, but you should have come in,
sweet mouse; then would you have been conscience-smitten
about all your dark surmisings. A murderer, forsooth! a
ghost! a phantom! Why, so civil was his manner that he
but asked for a cup of water in passing, and my grandmother
must needs have him come in out of the sun, and
rest him, and have some milk. Was that like a ghost? I
warrant you there was naught of the ghost about him when
she put a solid repast before him on the table: ghosts make
no such stout attacks on gooseberry tart and cheese, else
they be sore belied."</p>

<p>"But who and what is this man, Judith?"</p>

<p>"Why, who can tell what any man is?" said the other.
"They all of them are puzzles, and unlike other human
creatures. But this one&mdash;well, he hath a rare store of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>knowledge as to what is going forward at the court&mdash;and
among the players, too; and as we sat in the <span class="err" title="original: litttle">little</span> bower
there you would have sworn you could see before you the
river Thames, with a wonderful pageant on it&mdash;dolphins,
and whales, and crowned sea-queens, and the like; and in
the midst of them all the young Prince Henry&mdash;'Long live
the young Prince Henry!' they cried; and there was such
a noise of drums and cannons and trumpets that you could
scarce hear my grandmother's bees among the flowers. I
warrant you the good dame was well repaid for her entertainment,
and right well pleased with the young gentleman.
I should not marvel to find him returning thither,
seeing that he can remain there in secrecy, and have such
gossip as pleases him."</p>

<p>"But, Judith, you know not what you do!" her friend
protested, anxiously. "Do you forget&mdash;nay, you cannot
forget&mdash;that this was the very man the wizard prophesied
that you should meet; and, more than that, that he would
be your husband!"</p>

<p>"My husband?" said Judith, with a flush of color, and
she laughed uneasily. "Nay, not so, good Prudence. He
is not one that is likely to choose a country wench. Nay,
nay, the juggler knave failed me&mdash;that is the truth of it;
the charm was a thing of naught; and this young gentleman,
if I met him by accident, the same might have happened
to you, as I showed you before. Marry, I should
not much crave to see him again, if anything like that
were in the wind. This is Stratford town, 'tis not the forest
of Arden; and in this neighborhood a maiden may not
go forth to seek her lover, and coax him into the wooing
of her. My father may put that into a play, but methinks
if he heard of his own daughter doing the like, the key
would quickly be turned on her. Nay, nay, good Prue,
you shall not fright me out of doing a civil kindness to a
stranger, and one that is in misfortune, by flaunting his
lovership before my eyes. There be no such thing: do
not I know the tokens? By my life, this gentleman is too
courteous to have a lover's mind within him!"</p>

<p>"And you will go and see him again, Judith?" her friend
asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"Nay, I said not that," Judith answered, complacently.
"'Tis not the forest of Arden; would to Heaven it were,
for life would move to a pleasanter music! I said not that
I would go forth and seek him; that were not maidenly;
and belike there would come a coil of talking among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>gossips or soon or late; but at this time of the year, do
you see, sweet cousin, the country is fair to look upon,
and the air is sweeter in the meadows than it is here in
the town; and if a lone damsel, forsaken by all else, should
be straying silent and forlorn along the pathway or by the
river-side, and should encounter one that hath but lately
made her acquaintance, why should not that acquaintance
be permitted in all modesty and courtesy to ripen into
friendship? The harm, good Prue&mdash;the harm of it? Tush!
your head is filled with childish fears of the wizard; that
is the truth; and had you but come into the house to-day,
and had but five minutes' speech of the young gentleman,
you would have been as ready as any one to help in the
beguilement of the tedium of his hiding, if that be possible
to two or three silly women. And bethink you, was't not
a happy chance that I wore my new velvet cap this morning?"</p>

<p>But she had been speaking too eagerly. This was a slip;
and instantly she added, with some touch of confusion,</p>

<p>"I mean that I would fain have my father's friends in
London know that his family are not so far out of the
world, or out of the fashion."</p>

<p>"Is he one of your father's friends, Judith?" Prudence
said, gravely.</p>

<p>"He is a friend of my father's friends, at least," said she,
"and some day, I doubt not, he will himself be one of these.
Truly that will be a rare sight, some evening at New Place,
when we confront you with him, and tell him how he was
charged with being a ghost, or a pirate, or an assassin, or
something of the like."</p>

<p>"Your fancy runs free, Judith," her friend said. "Is't
a probable thing, think you, that one that dares not come
forth into the day, that is hiding from justice, or perchance
scheming in Catholic plots, should become the friend of
your house?"</p>

<p>"You saw him not at my grandmother's board, good
Prue," said Judith, coolly. "The young gentleman hath
the trick of making himself at home wherever he cometh,
I warrant you. And when this cloud blows away, and he
is free to come to Stratford, there is none will welcome
him more heartily than I, for methinks he holdeth Master
Benjamin Jonson in too high consideration, and I would
have him see what is thought of my father in the town,
and what his estate is, and that his family, though they
live not in London, are not wholly of Moll the milkmaid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>kind. And I would have Susan come over too; and were
she to forget her preachers and her psalms for but an evening,
and were there any merriment going forward, the
young gentleman would have to keep his wits clear, I'll
be bound. There is the house, too, I would have him see;
and the silver-topped tankard with the writing on it from
my father's good friends; nay, I warrant me Julius would
not think of denying me the loan of the King's letter to
my father&mdash;were it but for an hour or two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here they were startled into silence by a knocking
below; then there was the sound of a man's voice in the
narrow passage.</p>

<p>"'Tis he, sweetheart," Judith said, quickly, and she kissed
her friend, and gave a final touch to the ruff and the cap.
"Get you down and welcome him; I will go out when that
you have shut the door of the room. And be merry, good
heart, be merry&mdash;be brave and merry, as you love me."</p>

<p>She almost thrust her out of the apartment, and listened
to hear her descend the stairs; then she waited for the
shutting of the chamber door; and finally she stole noiselessly
down into the passage, and let herself out without
waiting for the little maid Margery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>A FIRST PERFORMANCE.</h3>

<p>"Nay, zur," said the sour-visaged Matthew, as he leaned
his chin and both hands on the end of a rake, and spoke
in his slow-drawling, grumbling fashion&mdash;"nay, zur, this
country be no longer the country it wur; no, nor never
will be again."</p>

<p>"Why, what ails the land?" said Judith's father, turning
from the small table in the summer-house, and lying back
in his chair, and crossing one knee over the other, as if he
would give a space to idleness.</p>

<p>"Not the land, zur," rejoined goodman Matthew, oracularly&mdash;"not
the land; it be the men that live in it, and
that are all in such haste to make wealth, with plundering
of the poor and each other, that there's naught but lying
and cheating and roguery&mdash;God-a-mercy, there never wur
the loike in any country under the sun! Why, zur, in my
vather's time a pair o' shoes would wear you through all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>weathers for a year; but now, with their half-tanned
leather, and their horse-hide, and their cat-skin for the
inner sole, 'tis a marvel if the rotten leaves come not asunder
within a month. And they be all aloike; the devil
would have no choice among 'em. The cloth-maker he
hideth his bad wool wi' liquid stuff; and the tailor, no
matter whether it be doublet, cloak, or hose, he will filch
you his quarter of the cloth ere you see it again; and the
chandler&mdash;he be no better than the rest&mdash;he will make you
his wares of stinking offal that will splutter and run over,
and do aught but give good light; and the vintner, marry,
who knoweth not his tricks and knaveries of mixing and
blending, and the selling of poison instead of honest liquor?
The rogue butcher, too, he will let the blood soak in, ay,
and puff wind into the meat&mdash;meat, quotha!&mdash;'tis as like
as not to have been found dead in a ditch!"</p>

<p>"A bad case indeed, good Matthew, if they be all preying
on each other so."</p>

<p>"'Tis the poor man pays for all, zur. Though how he
liveth to pay no man can tell; what with the landlords
racking the rents, and inclosing the commons and pasturages&mdash;nay,
'tis a noble pastime the making of parks and
warrens, and shutting the poor man out that used to have
his cow there and a pig or two; but no, now shall he not
let a goose stray within the fence. And what help hath
the poor man? May he go to the lawyers, with their
leases and clauses that none can understand&mdash;ay, and their
fists that must be well greased ere they set to the business?
'Tis the poor man pays for all, zur, I warrant ye; nor must
he grumble when the gentleman goes a-hunting and breaks
down his hedges and tramples his corn. Corn? 'Tis the
last thing they think of, beshrew me else! They are busiest
of all in sending our good English grain&mdash;ay, and our
good English beef and bacon and tallow&mdash;beyond the seas;
and to bring back what?&mdash;baubles of glass beads and
amber, fans for my ladies, and new toys from Turkey!
The proud dames&mdash;I would have their painted faces
scratched!"</p>

<p>"What, what, good Matthew?" Judith's father said,
laughing. "What know you of the city ladies and their
painting?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, zur, the London tricks be spread abroad, I
warrant ye; there's not a farmer's wife nowadays but must
have her french-hood, and her daughter a taffeta cap&mdash;marry,
and a grogram gown lined through with velvet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>And there be other towns in the land than London to learn
the London tricks; I have heard of the dames and their
daughters; set them up with their pinching and girding
with whalebone, to get a small waist withal!&mdash;ay, and the
swallowing of ashes and candles, and whatever will spoil
their stomach, to give them a pale bleak color. Lord,
what a thing 'tis to be rich and in the fashion!&mdash;let the
poor man suffer as he may. Corn, i' faith!&mdash;there be plenty
of corn grown in the land, God wot; but 'tis main too dear
for the poor man; the rack-rents for him, and a murrain
on him; the corn for the forestallers and the merchants
and gentlemen, that send it out of the country; and back
come the silks and civets for proud madam and her painted
crew!"</p>

<p>"God have mercy on us, man!" Judith's father exclaimed,
and he drove him aside, and got out into the sunlight. At
the same moment he caught sight of Judith herself.</p>

<p>"Come hither, wench, come hither!" he called to her.</p>

<p>She was nothing loath. She had merely been taking
some scraps to the Don; and seeing Matthew in possession
there, she had not even stayed to look into the summer-house.
But when her father came out and called to her,
she went quickly toward him; and her eyes were bright
enough, on this bright morning.</p>

<p>"What would you, father?"</p>

<p>For answer he plucked off her cap and threw it aside,
and took hold of her by a bunch of her now loosened and
short sun-brown curls.</p>

<p>"Father!" she protested (but with no great anger).
"There be twenty minutes' work undone!"</p>

<p>"Where bought you those roses?" said he, sternly.
"Answer me, wench!"</p>

<p>"I bought no roses, father!"</p>

<p>"The paint? Is't not painted? Where got you such a
face, madam?"</p>

<p>"Father, you have undone my hair; and the parson is
coming to dinner."</p>

<p>"Nay, I'll be sworn 'tis as honest a face as good Mother
Nature ever made. This goodman Matthew hath belied
you!"</p>

<p>"What said he of me?" she asked, with a flash of anger
in her eyes.</p>

<p>Her father put his hand on her neck, and led her away.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, come thy ways, lass; thou shalt pick me a
handful of raspberries. And as for thine hair, let that be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>as God made it; 'tis even better so; and yet, methinks"&mdash;here
he stopped, and passed his hand lightly once or
twice over her head, so that any half-imprisoned curls
were set free&mdash;"methinks," said he, regarding the pretty
hair with considerable favor, "if you would as lief have
some ornament for it, I saw that in London that would answer
right well. 'Twas a net-work kind of cap; but the
netting so fine you could scarce see it; and at each point
a bead of gold. Now, Madame Vanity, what say you to
that? Would you let your hair grow free as it is now, and
let the sunlight play with it, were I to bring thee a fairy
cap all besprinkled with gold?"</p>

<p>"I will wear it any way you wish, father, and right
gladly," said she, "and I will have no cap at all if it please
you."</p>

<p>"Nay, but you shall have the gossamer cap, wench; I
will not forget it when next I go to London."</p>

<p>"I would you had never to go to London again," said
she, rather timidly.</p>

<p>He regarded her for a second with a scrutinizing look,
and there was an odd sort of smile on his face.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "I was but this minute writing about
a man that had to use divers arts and devices for the attainment
of a certain end&mdash;yea, and devices that all the
world would not approve of, perchance; and that was ever
promising to himself that when the end was gained he
would put aside these spells and tricks, and be content to
live as other men live, in a quiet and ordinary fashion.
Wouldst have me live ever in Stratford, good lass?"</p>

<p>"The life of the house goes out when you go away from
us," said she, simply.</p>

<p>"Well, Stratford is no wilderness," said he, cheerfully;
"and I have no bitter feud with mankind that I would
live apart from them. Didst ever think, wench," he added,
more absently, "how sad a man must have been ere he
could speak so:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Happy were he could finish forth his fate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In some unhaunted desert, most obscure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all societies, from love and hate<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>"Is it that you are writing now, father?"</p>

<p>"Nay, indeed," said he, slowly, and a cloud came over
his face. "That was written by one that was my good
friend in by-gone days; by one that was betrayed and
done to death by lying tongues, and had but sorry favor
shown him in the end by those he had served."</p>

<p>He turned away. She thought she heard him say, "My
noble Essex," but she was mutely following him. And
then he said:</p>

<p>"Come, lass; come pick me the berries."</p>

<p>He kept walking up and down, by himself, while her
nimble fingers were busy with the bushes; and when she
had collected a sufficiency of the fruit, and brought it to
him, she found that he appeared to be in no hurry this
morning, but was now grown cheerful again, and rather
inclined to talk to her. And she was far from telling him
that her proper place at this moment was within-doors, to
see that the maids were getting things forward; and if she
bestowed a thought of any kind on the good parson, it
was to the effect that both he and the dinner would have
to wait. Her father had hold of her by the arm. He was
talking to her of all kinds of things, as they slowly walked
up and down the path, but of his friends in Stratford
mostly, and their various ways of living; and this she conceived
to have some reference to his project of withdrawing
altogether from London, and settling down for good
among them. Indeed, so friendly and communicative
was he on this clear morning&mdash;in truth, they were talking
like brother and sister&mdash;that when at last he went into the
summer-house, she made bold to follow; and when he
chanced to look at some sheets lying on the table, she
said:</p>

<p>"Father, what is the story of the man with the devices?"</p>

<p>For an instant he did not understand what she meant;
then he laughed.</p>

<p>"Nay, pay you no heed to such things, child."</p>

<p>"And why should not I, father, seeing that they bring
you so great honor?"</p>

<p>"Honor, said you?" but then he seemed to check himself.
This was not Julius Shawe, to whom he could speak
freely enough about the conditions of an actor's life in
London. "Well, then, the story is of a banished duke, a
man of great wisdom and skill, and he is living on a desert
island with his daughter&mdash;a right fair maiden she is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>too, and she has no other companion in the world but himself."</p>

<p>"But he is kind to her and good?" she said, quickly.</p>

<p>"Truly."</p>

<p>"What other companion would she have, then? Is she
not content&mdash;ay, and right well pleased withal?"</p>

<p>"Methinks the story would lag with but these," her
father said, with a smile. "Would you not have her furnished
with a lover&mdash;a young prince and a handsome&mdash;one
that would play chess with her, and walk with her while
her father was busy?"</p>

<p>"But how on a desert island? How should she find
such a one?" Judith said, with her eyes all intent.</p>

<p>"There, you see, is where the magic comes in. What if
her father have at his command a sprite, a goblin, that
can work all wonders&mdash;that can dazzle people in the dark,
and control the storm, and whistle the young prince to the
very feet of his mistress?"</p>

<p>Judith sighed, and glanced at the sheets lying on the
table.</p>

<p>"Alas, good father, why did you aid me in my folly,
and suffer me to grow up so ignorant?"</p>

<p>"Folly, fond wench!" said he, and he caught her by
the shoulders and pushed her out of the summer-house.
"Thank God you have naught to do with any such stuff.
There, go you and seek out Prudence, and get you into
the fields, and give those pink roses in your cheeks an airing.
Is't not a rare morning? And you would blear
your eyes with books, silly wench? Get you gone&mdash;into the
meadows with you&mdash;and you may gather me a nosegay if
your fingers would have work."</p>

<p>"I must go in-doors, father; good Master Blaise is
coming to dinner," said she; "but I will bring you the
nosegay in the afternoon, so please you. So fare you
well," she added; and she glanced at him, "and pray you,
sir, be kind to the young prince."</p>

<p>He laughed and turned away; and she hurried quickly
into the house. In truth, all through that day she had
plenty to occupy her attention; but whether it was the
maids that were asking her questions, or her mother
seeking her help, or good Master Walter paying authoritative
court to her, her eyes were entirely distraught. For
they saw before them a strange island, with magic surrounding
it, and two young lovers, and a grave and elderly
man regarding them; and she grew to wonder how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>much more of that story was shut up in the summer-house,
and to lament her misfortune in that she could not go
boldly to her father and ask him to be allowed to read it.
She felt quite certain that could she but sit down within
there and peruse these sheets for herself, he would not
say her nay; and from that conclusion to the next&mdash;that on
the first chances she would endeavor to borrow the sheets
and have them read to her&mdash;was but an obvious step, and
one that she had frequently taken before. Moreover, on
this occasion the chance came to her sooner than she
could have expected. Toward dusk in the evening her
father went out, saying that he was going along to see how
the Harts were doing. Matthew gardener was gone home;
the parson had left hours before; and her mother was
in the brew-house, and out of hearing. Finally, to crown
her good fortune, she discovered that the key had been
left in the door of the summer-house; and so the next
minute found her inside on her knees.</p>

<p>It was a difficult task. There was scarcely any light,
for she dare not leave the door open; and the mark that
she put on the sheets, to know which she had carried to
Prudence, was minute. And yet the sheets seemed to
have been tossed into this receptacle in fairly regular
order; and when at length, and after much straining of
her eyes, she had got down to the marked ones, she was
rejoiced to find that there remained above these a large
bulk of unperused matter, and the question was as to
how much it would be prudent to carry off. Further, she
had to discover where there was some kind of division, so
that the story should not abruptly break off; and she had
acquired some experience in this direction. In the end,
the portion of the play that she resolved upon taking with
her was modest and small; there would be the less likelihood
of detection; and it was just possible that she
would have no opportunity of returning the sheets that
night.</p>

<p>And then she quickly got in-doors, and put on her hood
and muffler, and slipped out into the dusk. She found
Prudence alone in the lower room, sitting sewing, the candles
on the table being already lit; and some distance off,
curled up and fast asleep on the floor, lay the little spaniel-gentle.</p>

<p>"Dear heart," said Judith, brightly, as she glanced at
the little dog, "you have shown good sense after all; I
feared me you would fall away from my wise counsel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>"My brother was well inclined to the little creature,"
Prudence said, with some embarrassment.</p>

<p>"And you had a right merry evening, I'll be bound,"
Judith continued, blithely. "And was there singing?&mdash;nay,
he can sing well when he is in the mood&mdash;none better.
Did he give you</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There is a garden in her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where roses and white lilies grow,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">for Julius is more light-hearted in such matters than you
are, dear mouse. And was there any trencher business&mdash;and
wine? I warrant me Julius would not have his guest
sit dry-throated. 'Twas a merry evening, in good sooth,
sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"<i>They</i> talked much together," Prudence said, with her
eyes cast down.</p>

<p>"They talked? Mercy on us, were you not civil to him?
Did you not thank him prettily for the little spaniel?"</p>

<p>"In a measure I think 'twas Julius took the little creature
from him," Prudence said, bashfully.</p>

<p>"Beshrew me now, but you know better!&mdash;'twas given
to you, you know right well. A spaniel-gentle for your
brother! As soon would he think of a farthingale and a
petticoat! And what did he say? Had he aught special
to say to you, dear mouse?"</p>

<p>"He would have me look at an ancient book he had,
with strange devices on the leaves," Prudence said. "Truly
'twas strange and wonderful, the ornamentation of it in
gold and colors, though I doubt me 'twas the work of
monks and priests. He would have me take it from him,"
she added, with a faint blush.</p>

<p>"And you would not, silly one?" Judith exclaimed,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Would you have me place such Popish emblems alongside
such a book as that that Dr. Hall gave me? Dear
Judith, 'twould be a pollution and a sin!"</p>

<p>"But you gave him thanks for the offer, then?"</p>

<p>"Of a surety; 'twas meant in friendship."</p>

<p>"Well, well; right glad am I to see the little beast
lying there; and methinks your gentleness hath cast a
spell o'er it already, sweetheart, or 'twould not rest so
soundly. And now, dear mouse, I have come to tax your
patience once more: see, here is part of the new play;
and we must go to your chamber, dear Prue, lest some
one come in and discover us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>Prudence laughed in her quiet fashion. "I think 'tis
you that casteth spells, Judith, else I should not be aiding
thee in this perilous matter."</p>

<p>But she took one of the candles in her hand nevertheless,
and led the way up-stairs; and then, when they had
carefully bolted the door, Judith placed the roll of sheets
on the table, and Prudence sat down to arrange and decipher
them.</p>

<p>"But this time," Judith said, "have I less weight on my
conscience; for my father hath already told me part of the
story, and why should not I know the rest? Nay, but it
promises well, I do assure thee, sweetheart. 'Tis a rare
beginning: the desert island, and the sprite that can work
wonders, and the poor banished duke and his daughter.
Ay, and there comes a handsome young prince, too;
marry, you shall hear of marvels! For the sprite is one
that can work magic at the bidding of the duke, and be
seen like a fire in the dark, and can lead a storm whither
he lists&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis with a storm that it begins," Prudence said, for
now she had arranged the sheets.</p>

<p>And instantly Judith was all attention. It is true, she
seemed to care little for the first scene and the squabbles
between the sailors and the gentlemen; she was anxious
to get to the enchanted island; and when at length Prudence
introduced Prospero and Miranda, Judith listened
as if a new world were being slowly opened before her.
And yet not altogether with silence, for sometimes she
would utter a few words of quick assent, or even explanation;
but always so as not to interfere with the gentle-voiced
reader. Thus it would go:</p>

<p>"Then Prospero says to her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">'Be collected:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more amazement: tell your piteous heart<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>"A right dutiful daughter!" Judith would exclaim&mdash;but
as apart. "A rare good wench, I warrant; and what
a gentle father he is withal!"</p>

<p>And then, when the banished duke had come to the end
of his story, and when he had caused slumber to fall upon
his daughter's eyes, and was about to summon Ariel, Judith
interposed to give the patient reader a rest.</p>

<p>"And what say you, Prudence?" said she, eagerly. "Is't
not a beautiful story? Is she not a sweet and obedient
maiden, and he a right noble and gentle father? Ah,
there, now, they may talk about their masques and pageants
of the court, and gods and goddesses dressed up to
saw the air with long speeches: see you what my father
can tell you in a few words, so that you can scarcely wait,
but you must on to hear the rest. And do I hurry you,
good Prue? Will you to it again? For now the spirit is
summoned that is to work the magic."</p>

<p>"Indeed, 'tis no heavy labor, Judith," her friend said,
with a smile. "And now here is your Ariel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All hail! great master! grave sir, hail! I come<br /></span>

<p class="noi">Then says Prospero:</p>

</div></div>

<p>"And hath he not done well, that clever imp!" Judith
cried. "Nay, but my father shall reward him&mdash;that he
shall&mdash;'twas bravely done and well. And now to bring him
to the maiden that hath never seen a sweetheart&mdash;that comes
next, good Prue? I marvel now what she will say?"</p>

<p>"'Tis not yet, Judith," her friend said, and she continued
the reading, while Judith sat and regarded the dusky
shadows beyond the flame of the candle as if wonder-land
were shining there. Then they arrived at Ariel's song,
"Come unto these yellow sands," and all the hushed air
around seemed filled with music; but it was distant, somehow,
so that it did not interfere with Prudence's gentle
voice.</p>

<p>"Then says Prospero to her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say what thou seest yond.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Miranda.</i>
<span style="margin-left: 10%">What is't? a spirit?</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Prospero.</i> No, wench; it eats and sleeps, and hath such senses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Miranda.</i>
<span style="margin-left: 10%">I might call him</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thing divine, for nothing natural<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ever saw so noble.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And what says he? What thinks he of her?" Judith
said, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>"Nay, first the father says&mdash;to himself, as it were</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="noi">And then the Prince says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Most sure, the goddess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe, my prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May know, if you remain upon this island;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that you will some good instruction give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I may bear me here; my prime request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you be maid or no?<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Miranda.</i>
<span style="margin-left: 10%">No wonder, sir,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But certainly a maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Ferdinand.</i>
<span style="margin-left: 10%">My language! heavens!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the best of them that speak this speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were I but where 'tis spoken.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But would he take her away?" said Judith, quickly
(but to herself, as it were). "Nay, never so! They must
remain on the island&mdash;the two happy lovers&mdash;with Ariel to
wait on them: surely my father will so make it?"</p>

<p>Then, as it appeared, came trouble to check the too
swift anticipations of the Prince, though Judith guessed
that the father of Miranda was but feigning in his wrath;
and when Prudence finally came to the end of such sheets
as had been brought her, and looked up, Judith's eyes
were full of confidence and pride&mdash;not only because she
was sure that the story would end happily, but also because
she would have her chosen gossip say something about
what she had read.</p>

<p>"Well?" said she.</p>

<p>"'Tis a marvel," Prudence said, with a kind of sigh,
"that shapes of the air can so take hold of us."</p>

<p>Judith smiled; there was something in her manner that
Prudence did not understand.</p>

<p>"And Master Jonson, good Prue&mdash;that they call Ben
Jonson&mdash;what of him?"</p>

<p>"I know not what you mean, Judith."</p>

<p>"Sure you know they make so much of him at the court,
and of his long speeches about Greece and Rome and the
like; and when one comes into the country with news of
what is going forward, by my life you'd think that Master
Jonson were the only writer in the land! What say you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>good Prue: could worthy Master Jonson invent you a
scene like that?"</p>

<p>"In truth I know not, Judith; I never read aught of
his writing."</p>

<p>Judith took over the sheets and carefully rolled them
up.</p>

<p>"Why," said she, "'twas my father brought him forward,
and had his first play taken in at the theatre!"</p>

<p>"But your father and he are great friends, Judith, as I am
told; why should you speak against him?"</p>

<p>"I speak against him?" said Judith, as she rose, and
there was an air of calm indifference on her face. "In
truth, I have naught to say against the good man. 'Tis
well that the court ladies are pleased with Demogorgons
and such idle stuff, and 'tis passing well that he knows the
trade. Now give ye good-night and sweet dreams, sweet
mouse; and good thanks, too, for the reading."</p>

<p>But at the door below&mdash;Prudence having followed her
with the candle&mdash;she turned, and said, in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Now tell me true, good cousin: think you my father
hath ever done better than this magic island, and the sweet
Miranda, and the rest?"</p>

<p>"You know I am no judge of such matters, Judith," her
friend answered.</p>

<p>"But, dear heart, were you not bewitched by it? Were
you not taken away thither? Saw you not those strange
things before your very eyes?"</p>

<p>"In good sooth, then, Judith," said the other, with a
smile, "for the time being I knew not that I was in Stratford
town, nor in our own country of England either."</p>

<p>Judith laughed lightly and quickly, and with a kind of
pride too. And when she got home to her own room, and
once more regarded the roll of sheets, before bestowing
them away in a secret place, there was a fine bravery of
triumph in her eyes. "Ben Jonson!" she said, but no
longer with any anger, rather with a sovereign contempt.
And then she locked up the treasure in her small cupboard
of boxes, and went down-stairs again to seek out her
mother, her heart now quite recovered from its envy, and
beating warm and equally in its disposition toward all mankind,
and her mind full of a perfect and complacent confidence.
"Ben Jonson!" she said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></h2>

<h3>BY THE RIVER.</h3>

<p>The next morning she was unusually demure, and yet
merry withal. In her own chamber, as she chose out a
petticoat of pale blue taffeta, and laid on the bed her
girdle of buff-colored leather, and proceeded to array herself
in these and other braveries, it was to the usual accompaniment
of thoughtless and quite inconsequent ballad-singing.
At one moment it was "Green-sleeves was
all my joy," and again "Fair, fair, and twice so fair," or
perhaps&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"An ambling nag, and a-down, a-down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have borne her away to Dargison."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">But when she came to take forth from the cupboard of
boxes the portion of the play she had locked up there the
night before, and when she carefully placed that in a
satchel of dark blue velvet that she had attached to the
girdle, she was silent; and when she went down-stairs
and encountered her mother, there was a kind of anxious
innocence on her face. The good parson (she explained)
had remained so late on the previous afternoon, and there
were so many things about the house she had to attend to,
that she had been unable to get out into the fields, as her
father had bade her, to bring him home some wild flowers.
Besides, as every one knew, large dogs got weak in the
hind-legs if they were kept chained up too continuously;
and it was absolutely necessary she should take Don Roderigo
out for a run with her through the meadows, if her
father would permit.</p>

<p>"There be plenty of flowers in the garden, surely," her
mother said, who was busy with some leather hangings,
and wanted help.</p>

<p>"But he would liefer have some of the little wildlings,
good mother," said Judith. "That I know right well;
for he is pleased to see them lying on the table before
him; and sometimes, too, he puts the names of them in
his writing."</p>

<p>"How know you that?" was the immediate and sharp
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>"As I have heard, good mother," Judith said, with calm
equanimity.</p>

<p>And then she went to the small mirror to see that her
gray velvet cap and starched ruff were all right.</p>

<p>"What can your father want with wild flowers if he is
to remain the whole day at Warwick!" her mother said.</p>

<p>"Is my father gone to Warwick?" she asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"If he be not already set forth."</p>

<p>She glanced at the window; there was neither horse
nor serving-men waiting there. And then she hastily went
out and through the back yard into the garden; and there,
sure enough was her father, ready booted for the road,
and giving a few parting directions to his bailiff.</p>

<p>"Well, wench," he said, when he had finished with the
man, "what would you?"</p>

<p>She had taken from her purse all the money she could
find there.</p>

<p>"Good father," said she, "will you do this errand for
me at Warwick?"</p>

<p>"More vanities?" said he. "I wonder you have no
commissioner to despatch to Spain and Flanders. What
is't, then?&mdash;a muff of satin&mdash;a gimmal ring&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, not so, father; I would have you buy for me
a clasp-knife&mdash;as good a one as the money will get; and
the cutler must engrave on the blade, or on the handle, I
care not which, a message&mdash;an inscription, as it were; 'tis
but three words&mdash;<i>For Judith's Sweetheart</i>. Could you remember
that, good father? Is't too much of a trouble?"</p>

<p>"How now?" said he. "For whom do you wish me to
bring you such a token?"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," said she, demurely, "would you have me
name names? The gift of a sweetheart is a secret thing."</p>

<p>"You are a mad wench," said he (though doubtless he
guessed for whom the knife was intended), and he called
to Matthew gardener to go round and see if Master Shawe
were not yet ready. "But now I bethink me, child, I have
a message for thee. Good Master Walter spoke to me
yesternight about what much concerns him&mdash;and you."</p>

<p>Instantly all her gay self-confidence vanished; she became
confused, anxious, timid; and she regarded him as
if she feared what his look or manner might convey.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she said, in rather a low voice.</p>

<p>"Well, you know what the good man wishes," her father
said, "and he spoke fairly, and reasoneth well. Your
mother, too, would be right well pleased."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>"And you, sir?" she said, rather faintly.</p>

<p>"I?" said he. "Nay, 'tis scarce a matter that I can say
aught in. 'Tis for yourself to decide, wench; but were
you inclined to favor the young parson, I should be well
pleased enough&mdash;indeed 'tis so&mdash;a good man and honest,
as I take him to be, of fair attainment, and I know of none
that bear him ill-will, or have aught to say against him.
Nay, if your heart be set that way, wench, I see no harm;
you are getting on in years to be still in the unmarried
state; and, as he himself says, there would be security in
seeing you settled in a home of your own, and your future
no longer open and undecided. Nay, nay, I see no harm.
He reasons well."</p>

<p>"But, father, know you why he would have me become
his wife?" Judith said, with a wild feeling overcoming
her that she was drowning and must needs throw out her
hands for help. "'Tis for no matter of affection that I can
make out&mdash;or that he might not as well choose any other
in the town; but 'tis that I should help him in his work,
and&mdash;and labor in the vineyard, as he said. In truth I am
all unfit for such a task&mdash;there be many another far better
fitted than I; my mother must know that right well. There
is little that I would not do to please her; but surely we
might all of us have just as much of the good man's company
without this further bond. But what say you, father?
What is your wish?" she added, humbly. "Perchance I
could bring my mind to it if all were anxious that it should
be so."</p>

<p>"Why, I have told thee, wench, thou must choose for
thyself. 'Twould please your mother right well, as I say;
and as for the duties of a parson's wife&mdash;nay, nay, they are
none so difficult. Have no fears on that score, good lass;
I dare be sworn you are as honest and well-minded as
most, though perchance you make less profession of it."
(The gratitude that sprang to her eyes, and shone there, in
spite of her downcast face!) "Nor must you think the
good parson has but that end in view; 'tis not in keeping
with his calling that he should talk the language of romance.
And there is more for you to think of. Even if
Master Blaise be no vehement lover, as some of the young
rattlepates might be, that is but a temporary thing; 'tis
the long years of life that weigh for the most; and all
through these you would be in an honorable station, well
thought of, and respected. Nay, there be many, I can tell
thee, lass, that might look askance now at the player's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>daughter, who would be right glad to welcome the parson's
wife."</p>

<p>"What say you, father?" said she&mdash;and she was so
startled that the blood forsook her lips for a moment.
"That&mdash;that there be those&mdash;who scorn the player's daughter&mdash;and
would favor the parson's wife?" And then she
instantly added: "I pray you, sir, did not you say that I
was to decide for myself?"</p>

<p>"Truly, child, truly," said he, somewhat wondering at
her manner, for her face had grown quite pale.</p>

<p>"Then I have decided, father."</p>

<p>"And how? What answer will you have for Master
Walter?"</p>

<p>She spoke slowly now, and with a distinctness that was
almost harsh.</p>

<p>"This, so please you, sir&mdash;that the player's daughter
shall not, and shall never, become the parson's wife, God
helping her!"</p>

<p>"Why, how now? what a coil is this!" he exclaimed.
"Good lass, 'twas not the parson that said aught of the
kind. Lay not that to his charge, in fair honesty."</p>

<p>"I have decided," she said proudly and coldly. "Father,
the horses are brought round&mdash;I can hear them. You will
not forget the knife, and the message on the blade?"</p>

<p>He looked at her, and laughed, but in a kindly way;
and he took her by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Nay, now, wench, thou shalt not throw over the good
man for a matter that was none of his bringing forward.
And why should you wish to have less than the respect
of all your neighbors, all and sundry, whatever be their
views? In good sooth I meant to speak for the parson,
and not to harm him; and when I have more time I
must undo the ill that I have done him. So soften your
heart, you proud one, and be thankful for the honor
he would do you; and think over it; and be civil and
grateful."</p>

<p>"Nay, I will be civil enough to the good minister," said
she, with a return to her ordinary placid humor, "if he
speak no more of making me his wife."</p>

<p>"He will win you yet, for as stubborn as you are," her
father said, with a smile. "He hath a rare gift of reason:
do not say nay too soon, wench, lest you have to recall
your words. Fare you well, lass, fare you well."</p>

<p>"And forget not the knife, good father. '<i>With Judith's
Love</i>,' or '<i>For Judith's Sweetheart</i>,' or what you will." And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>then she added, daringly: "'Tis for the young prince
Mamillius, if you must know, good sir."</p>

<p>He was just going away; but this caused him to stop
for a second; and he glanced at her with a curious kind
of suspicion. But her eyes had become quite inscrutable.
Whatever of dark mischief was within them was not to be
made out but by further questioning, and for that he had
now no time. So she was left alone, mistress of the field,
and rather inclined to laugh at her own temerity; until it
occurred to her that now she could go leisurely forth for
her stroll along the banks of the Avon, taking the great
dog with her.</p>

<p>Indeed, her anger was always short-lived. Or perhaps
it was the feeling that this danger was got rid of&mdash;that the
decision was taken, and the parson finally and altogether
left behind her&mdash;that now raised her spirits. At all events,
as she went along the thoroughfare, and cheerfully greeted
those that met her, the neighbors said 'twas little wonder
that Master William Shakespeare's second daughter put
off the choosing of a mate for herself, for that she seemed to
grow younger and more winsome every day. And she knew
all the children by name, and had a word for them&mdash;scolding
or merry, as the case might be&mdash;when that she passed
them by; and what with the clear sunlight of the morning,
and the fresher atmosphere as she got out of the town,
it seemed to herself as if all the air were filled with music.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then sigh not so, but let them go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be you blithe and bonny,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">she said or sung to herself; and she had not a trace of ill-will
in her mind against the parson (although she did not
fail to recollect that she was a player's daughter); and she
was admonishing the Don to take good care of her, for
that phantom conspirators and such like evil creatures
might be about. And so she got down to the river-side;
but she did not cross; she kept along by the path that followed
the windings of the stream, between the wide meadows
and the luxurious vegetation that overhung the current.</p>

<p>This English-looking landscape was at its fairest on this
fair morning, for some heavy rain in the night had washed
the atmosphere clear; everything seemed sharp and luminous;
and the rows of trees along the summits of the distant
and low-lying hills were almost black against the white
and blue sky. Nearer her all the foliage of the wide-branching
elms was stirring and rustling before a soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>westerly breeze; the flooded river was of a tawny brown;
while its banks were a wilderness of wild flowers between
the stems of the stunted willows&mdash;straggling rose-bushes
of white and red, tall masses of goose-grass all powdered
over with cream-white blossom, a patch of fragrant meadow-sweet
here and there, or an occasional blood-red poppy
burning among the dark, dull greens. And as for companions?
Well, she caught a glimpse of a brood of ducks
sidling along by the reeds, and tried to follow them, but
the bushes shut them out from her sight. A mare and her
foal, standing under the cool shadow of the trees, gazed
blankly at her as she passed. Further off there were some
shorn sheep in the meadows; but she could see no shepherd.
The harsh note of the corn-crake sounded somewhere
in the long grass; and the bees were busy; and now
and again a blue-backed swallow would swoop by her and
over the stream; while all around there was a smell of
clover sweetening the westerly wind. At this moment,
she convinced herself, she bore no ill-will at all against the
good parson: only that she had it in her mind that she
would be well content to remain a player's daughter. Her
condition, she imagined, was one that she did not desire to
have bettered. Why, the air that touched her cheek was
like velvet; and there could be nothing in the world fairer
than the pink and white roses bestarring the bushes there;
and the very pulse of her blood seemed to beat to an unheard
and rhythmical and subtle tune. What was it her
father had said? "I dare be sworn you are as honest and
well-minded as most, though perchance you make less
profession of it." She laughed to herself, with a kind of
pride. And she was so well content that she wished she
had little Willie Hart here, that she might put her hand on
his shoulder and pet him, and convey to him some little of
that satisfaction that reigned within her own bosom. No
matter; he should have the clasp-knife&mdash;"<i>With Judith's
Love</i>;" and right proud he would be of that, she made
sure. And so she went idly on her way, sometimes with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair, fair, and twice so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair as any may be,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">coming uncalled for into her head; and always with an eye
to the various wild flowers, to see what kind of a nosegay
she would be able to gather on her homeward walk.</p>

<p>But by and by her glances began to go further afield.
Master Leofric Hope, in his brief references to his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>habits and condition at the farm, had incidentally remarked
that of all his walks abroad he preferred the following of
the path by the river-side; for there he was most secure
from observation. Nay, he said that sometimes, after continued
solitude, a longing possessed him to see a town&mdash;to
see a populated place filled with a fair number of his fellow-creatures&mdash;and
that he would come within sight of
Stratford itself and have a look at the church, and the
church spire, and the thin blue smoke rising over the
houses. That, he said, was safer for him than coming over
such an exposed thoroughfare as Bardon Hill; and then
again, when he was of a mind to read&mdash;for this time he had
brought one or two books with him&mdash;he could find many
a sheltered nook by the side of the stream, where even a
passer-by would not suspect his presence. Nor could
Judith, on this fresh, warm, breezy morning, conceal from
herself the true object of her coming forth. If she had
tried to deceive herself, the contents of the blue velvet
satchel would have borne crushing testimony against her.
In truth she was now looking with some eagerness to find
whether, on such a pleasant morning, it was possible that
he could have remained within-doors, and with the very distinct
belief that sooner or later she would encounter him.</p>

<p>Nor was she mistaken, though the manner of the meeting
was unexpected. The mastiff happened to have gone
on a yard or two in front of her, and she was paying but
little attention to the beast, when all of a sudden it
stopped, became rigid, and uttered a low growl. She
sprang forward and seized it by the collar. At the same
instant she caught sight of some one down by the water's
edge, where, but for this occurrence, he would doubtless
have escaped observation. It was Leofric Hope, without
a doubt; for now he was clambering up through the
bushes, and she saw that he had a small book in his hand.</p>

<p>"My good fortune pursues me, fair Mistress Judith," said
he (but with a watchful eye on the dog), "that I should so
soon again have an opportunity of meeting with you. But
perchance your protector is jealous? He likes not strangers?"</p>

<p>"A lamb, sir&mdash;a very lamb!" Judith said, and she patted
the dog and coaxed him, and got him into a more friendly&mdash;or
at least neutral and watchful&mdash;frame of mind.</p>

<p>"I marvel not you have come forth on such a morning,"
said he, regarding the fresh color in her face. "'Tis a rare
morning; and 'tis a rare chance for one that is a prisoner,
as it were, that his dungeon is not four walls, but the wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>spaces of Warwickshire. Will you go further? May I
attend you?"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," said she, "I but came forth to look at the
country, and see what blossoms I could carry back to my
father; I will go as far as the stile there, and rest a few
minutes, and return."</p>

<p>"'Tis like your kindness, sweet lady, to vouchsafe me a
moment's conversation; a book is but a dull companion,"
said he, as they walked along to the stile that formed part
of a boundary hedge. And when they reached it she seated
herself on the wooden bar with much content, and the
mastiff lay down, stretching out his paws, while the young
gentleman stood idly&mdash;but not carelessly&mdash;by. He seemed
more than ever anxious to interest his fair neighbor, and
so to beguile her into remaining.</p>

<p>"A dull companion," he repeated, "it is. One would
rather hear the sound of one's voice occasionally. When
I came along here this morning I should have been right
glad even to have had a she shepherd say 'Good Morrow'
to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A what, good sir?" she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Nay, 'tis a book the wits in London have much merriment
over just now&mdash;a guide-book for the use of foreigners
coming to this country&mdash;and there be plenty of them at
present, in the train of the ambassadors. Marry, the good
man's English is none of the best. '<i>For to ask the Way</i>' is
a chapter of the book; and the one traveller saith to the
other, '<i>Ask of that she shepherd</i>'&mdash;in truth the phrase hath
been caught up by the town. But the traveller is of a
pleasant and courteous turn; when that he would go to
bed, he saith to the chambermaid: 'Draw the curtains, and
pin them with a pin. My she friend, kiss me once, and I
shall sleep the better. I thank you, fair maiden.' Well,
their English may be none of the best, but they have a
royal way with them, some of those foreigners that come
to our court. When the Constable of Castile was at the
great banquet at Whitehall&mdash;doubtless you heard of it,
sweet Mistress Judith?&mdash;he rose and drank the health of
the Queen from a cup of agate of extraordinary value, all
set with diamonds and rubies, and when the King had
drank from the same cup the Constable called a servant,
and desired that the cup should be placed on his Majesty's
buffet, to remain there. Was't not a royal gift? And so
likewise he drank the health of the King from a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>dragon-shaped cup of crystal all garnished with gold; but
he drank from the cover only, for the Queen, standing up,
drank the pledge from the cup itself; and then he would
have that in turn transferred to her buffet, as he had given
the other one to the King."</p>

<p>"My father," said she, with much complacent good-nature&mdash;for
she had got into the way of talking to this young
gentleman with a marvellous absence of restraint or country
shyness, "hath a tankard of great age and value, and
on the silver top of it is a tribute engraved from many of
his friends&mdash;truly I would that you could come and see it,
good sir&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;my father, too, he would make you
welcome, I doubt not. And what book is it," she continued,
with a smile, "that you have for companion, seeing
that there be no she shepherd for you to converse withal?"</p>

<p>"'Tis but a dull affair," said he, scarce looking at it, for
Judith's eyes were more attractive reading. "And yet if
the book itself be dull, there is that within its boards that
is less so. Perchance you have not heard of one Master
Browne, a young Devonshire gentleman, that hath but late
come to London, and that only for a space, as I reckon?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," she said hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"The young man hath made some stir with his poems,"
he continued, "though there be none of them in the booksellers'
hands as yet. And as it hath been my good fortune
to see one or two of them&mdash;marry, I am no judge, but I
would call them excellent, and of much modesty and
grace&mdash;I took occasion to pencil down a few of the lines
inside the cover of this little book. May I read them to
you Mistress Judith?"</p>

<p>"If it please you, good sir."</p>

<p>He opened the book, and she saw that there were some
lines pencilled on the gray binding; but they must have
been familiar to him, for he scarce took his eyes from
Judith's face as he repeated them.</p>

<p>"They are a description," said he, "of one that must
have been fair indeed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Her cheeks, the wonder of what eye beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Begot betwixt a lily and a rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gentle rising plains divinely swelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where all the graces and the loves repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature in this piece all her works excelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet showed herself imperfect in the close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she forgot (when she so fair did raise her)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give the world a wit might duly praise her.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span><span class="i0">'When that she spoke, as at a voice from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On her sweet words all ears and hearts attended;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that she sung, they thought the planets seven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By her sweet voice might well their tunes have mended;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she did sigh, all were of joy bereaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when she smiled, heaven had them all befriended:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that her voice, sighs, smiles, so many thrilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, had she kissed, how many had she killed!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'Tis a description of a lady of the court?" Judith asked
timidly.</p>

<p>"No, by heavens," he said, with warmth; "the bonniest
of our English roses are they that grow in the country air!"
and his glance of admiration was so open and undisguised,
and the application of his words so obvious, that
her eyes fell, and in spite of herself the color mounted to
her cheeks. In her embarrassment she sought safety in
the blue velvet satchel. She had contemplated some other
way of introducing this latest writing of her father's; but
now that had all fled from her brain. She knew that the
town gentlemen were given to flattery; but then she was
not accustomed to it. And she could not but swiftly surmise
that he had written down these lines with the especial
object of addressing them to her when he should have the
chance.</p>

<p>"Good sir," said she, endeavoring to hide this brief embarrassment
by assuming a merry air, "a fair exchange,
they say, is no robbery. Methinks you will find something
here that will outweigh good Master Browne's verses&mdash;in
bulk, if not in merit."</p>

<p>He gazed in astonishment at the parcel of sheets she
handed to him, and he but glanced at the first page when
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why, I have heard naught of this before."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," said she, with a calm smile, "the infant is
but young&mdash;but a few weeks, as I take it; it hath had but
little chance of making a noise in the world as yet. Will
you say what you think of it?"</p>

<p>But now he was busy reading. Then by and by she
recollected something of the manner in which she had
meant to introduce the play.</p>

<p>"You see, sir, my father hath many affairs on his hands;
'tis not all his time he can give to such things. And yet
I have heard that they be well spoken of in London&mdash;if
not by the wits, perchance, or by the court ladies, at least
by the common people and the 'prentices. We in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>parts have but little skill of learning; but&mdash;but methinks
'tis a pretty story&mdash;is it not, good sir?&mdash;and perchance
as interesting as a speech from a goddess among the
clouds?"</p>

<p>"In truth it is a rare invention," said he, but absently,
for his whole and rapt attention was fixed on the sheets.</p>

<p>She, seeing him so absorbed, did not interfere further.
She sat still and content&mdash;perhaps with a certain sedate
triumph in her eyes. She listened to the rustling of the
elms overhead, and watched the white clouds slowly crossing
the blue, and the tawny-hued river lazily and noiselessly
stealing by below the bushes. The corn-crake was
silent now&mdash;there was not even that interruption; and
when the bell in the church tower began to toll, it was so
soft and faint and distant that she thought it most likely he
would not even hear it. And at what point was he now?
At the story of how the sweet Miranda came to grow up
in exile? Or listening to Ariel's song? Or watching the
prince approach this new wonder of the magic island?
Her eyes were full of triumph. "Ben Jonson!" she had
said.</p>

<p>But suddenly he closed the sheets together.</p>

<p>"It were unmannerly so to keep you waiting," said he.</p>

<p>"Nay, heed not that, good sir," she said instantly. "I
pray you go on with the reading. How like you it? 'Tis
a pretty story, methinks; but my father hath been so busy
of late&mdash;what with acres, and tithes, and sheep, and malt
and the like&mdash;that perchance he hath not given all his
mind to it."</p>

<p>"It is not for one such as I, fair Mistress Judith," said
he, with much modesty, "to play the critic when it is your
father's writing that comes forward. Beshrew me, there
be plenty of that trade in London, and chiefly the feeble
folk that he hath driven from our stage. No, sweet lady;
rather consider me one of those that crowd to see each
new piece of his, and are right thankful for aught he pleaseth
to give us."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said she; and she regarded him with
much favor, which he was not slow to perceive.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, boldly, "what needs your father to
heed if some worshipful Master Scoloker be of opinion
that the play of the Prince Hamlet belongeth to the vulgar
sort, and that the prince was but moon-sick; or that
some one like Master Greene&mdash;God rest his soul, wherever
it be!&mdash;should call him an upstart crow, and a Johannes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>factotum, and the like? 'Tis what the people of England
think that is of import; and right sure am I what
they would say&mdash;that there is no greater writer than your
father now living in the land."</p>

<p>"Ah, think you so?" she said, quickly, and her face grew
radiant, as it were, and her eyes were filled with gratitude.</p>

<p>"This Master Greene," he continued, "was ever jibing
at the players, as I have heard, and bidding them be more
humble, for that their labor was but mechanical, and them
attracting notice through wearing borrowed plumes. Nay,
he would have it that your father was no more than that&mdash;poor
man, he lived but a sorry life, and 'twere ill done
to cherish anger against him; but I remember to have
seen the apology that he that published the book made
thereafter to your father&mdash;in good truth it was fitting and
right that it should be printed and given to the world;
and though I forget the terms of it, 'twas in fair praise of
Master William Shakespeare's gentle demeanor, and his
uprightness of conduct, and the grace of his wit."</p>

<p>"Could you get that for me, good sir?" said she, eagerly.
"Is't possible that I could get it?"</p>

<p>And then she stopped in some embarrassment, for she
remembered that it was not becoming she should ask this
stranger for a gift. "Nay, sir, 'twould be of little use to
me, that have no skill of reading."</p>

<p>"But I pray you, sweet Mistress Judith, to permit me
to bring you the book; 'twill be something, at least, for
you to keep and show to your friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I might show it to Prudence Shawe, I could return
it to you, good sir," said she. And then she added, "Not
that she&mdash;no, nor any one in Stratford town&mdash;would need
any such testimony to my father's qualities, that are
known to all."</p>

<p>"At least they seem to have won him the love and loyalty
of his daughter," said he, gallantly; "and they know
most about a man who live nearest him. Nay, but I will
beg you to accept the book from me when I can with
safety get to London again; 'twill be a charge I am not
likely to forget. And in return, fair Mistress Judith, I
would take of you another favor and a greater."</p>

<p>"In what manner, gentle sir?"</p>

<p>"I have but glanced over this writing, for fear of detaining
you, and but half know the value of it," said he.
"I pray you let me have it with me to my lodging for an
hour or two, that I may do it justice. When one hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>such a chance come to him, 'tis not to be lightly treated,
and I would give time and quiet to the making out the
beauties of your father's latest work."</p>

<p>She was at first somewhat startled by this proposal, and
almost involuntarily was for putting forth her hand to receive
the sheets again into safe-keeping; but then she
asked herself what harm there could be in acceding to his
request. She was eagerly anxious that he should understand
how her father&mdash;even amidst those multifarious occupations
that were entailed on him by his prominent
position in the town&mdash;could, when he chose, sit down and
write a tale far exceeding in beauty and interest any of
the mummeries that the court people seemed to talk
about. Why should not he have a few hours' time to
study this fragment withal? Her father had gone to Warwick
for the day. Nay, more, she had taken so small a
portion of what had been cast aside that she knew the absence
of it would not be noticed, however long it might
be kept. And then this young gentleman, who was so
civil and courteous, and who spoke so well of her father,
was alone, and to be pitied for that he had so few means
of beguiling the tedium of his hiding.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon," said he, seeing that she hesitated,
"I could with safety leave it at your grandmother's cottage,
and then, perchance, you might send some one for it.
Nay, believe me, sweet Mistress Judith, I know the value
of that I ask; but I would fain do justice to such a treasure."</p>

<p>"You would not fail me, sir, in leaving it at the cottage?"
said she.</p>

<p>"You do me wrong, Mistress Judith, to doubt&mdash;in good
sooth you do. If you can find a trusty messenger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, but I will come for it myself, good sir, and explain
to my grandmother the nature of the thing, lest she
suspect me of meddling with darker plots. Let it be so,
then, good sir, for now I must get me back to the town.
I pray you forget not to leave the package; and so&mdash;farewell!"</p>

<p>"But my thanks to you, dear lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," said she, with a bright look of her eyes
"bethink you you have not yet fairly made out the matter.
Tarry till you have seen whether these sheets be worth
the trouble&mdash;whether they remind you in aught of the
work of your friend Master Jonson&mdash;and then your thanks
will be welcome. Give ye good-day, gentle sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>There was no thought in her mind that she had done
anything imprudent in trusting him with this portion of
the play for the matter of an hour or two; it was but a
small equivalent, she recollected, for his promise to bring
her from London the retractation or apology of one of
those who had railed at her father, or abetted in that, and
found himself constrained by his conscience to make
amends. And now it occurred to her that it would look
ill if, having come out to gather some wild flowers for the
little table in the summer-house, she returned with empty
hands; so, as she proceeded to walk leisurely along the
winding path leading back to the town, she kept picking
here and there such blossoms as came within her reach.
If the nosegay promised to be somewhat large and straggling,
at least it would be sweet-scented, and she felt
pretty sure that her father would be well content with it.
At first she was silent, however; her wonted singing was
abandoned; perchance she was trying to recall something
of the lines that Master Leofric Hope had repeated to her
with so marked an emphasis.</p>

<p>"And what said he of our English roses?" she asked
herself, with some faint color coming into her face at the
mere thought of it.</p>

<p>But then she forcibly dismissed these recollections, feeling
that that was due to her own modesty, and busied herself
with her blossoms and sprays; and presently, as she
set out in good earnest for the town, she strove to convince
herself that there was nothing more serious in her brain
than the tune of "Green-sleeves:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Green-sleeves, now farewell, adieu;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God I pray to prosper thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am still thy lover true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come once again and love me!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>WILD WORDS.</h3>

<p>Her light-heartedness did not last long. In the wide
clear landscape a human figure suddenly appeared, and
the briefest turn of her head showed her that Tom Quiney
was rapidly coming toward her across the fields. For a
second her heart stood still. Had he been riding home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>from Ludington? Or from Bidford? Was it possible that
he had come over Bardon Hill, and from that height espied
the two down by the river? She could not even tell whether
that was possible, or what he had done with his horse, or
why he had not interfered sooner, if he was bent on interfering.
But she had an alarmed impression that this
rapid approach of his boded trouble, and she had not long
to wait before that fear was confirmed.</p>

<p>"Judith, who is that man?" he demanded, with a fury
that was but half held in.</p>

<p>She turned and faced him.</p>

<p>"I knew not," she said, coldly and slowly, "that we
were on a speaking platform."</p>

<p>"'Tis no time to bandy words," said he; and his face
was pale, for he was evidently striving to control the passion
with which his whole figure seemed to quiver from
head to heel. "Who is that man? I ask. Who is he, that
you come here to seek him, and alone?"</p>

<p>"I know not by what right you put such questions to
me," she said; but she was somewhat frightened.</p>

<p>"By what right? And you have no regard, then, for
your good name?"</p>

<p>There was a flash in her eyes. She had been afraid; she
was no longer afraid.</p>

<p>"My good name?" she repeated. "I thank God 'tis in
none of your keeping!"</p>

<p>In his madness he caught her by the wrist.</p>

<p>"You shall tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unhand me, sir!" she exclaimed; and she threw off
his grasp, while her cheeks burned with humiliation.</p>

<p>"Nay, I quarrel not with women," said he. "I crave
your pardon. But, by God, I will get to know that man's
name and purpose here if I rive it from his body!"</p>

<p>So he strode off in the direction that Leofric Hope had
taken; and for a moment she stood quite terror-stricken
and helpless, scarcely daring to think of what might happen.
A murder on this fair morning? This young fellow, that
was quite beside himself in his passion of jealous anger,
was famed throughout the length and breadth of Warwickshire
for his wrestling prowess. And the other&mdash;would he
brook high words? These things flashed across her mind
in one bewildering instant; and in her alarm she forgot
all about her pride. She called to him,</p>

<p>"I pray you&mdash;stay!"</p>

<p>He turned and regarded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>"Stay," said she, with her face afire. "I&mdash;I will tell
you what I know of him&mdash;if you will have it so."</p>

<p>He approached her with seeming reluctance, and with
anger and suspicion in his lowering look. He was silent,
too.</p>

<p>"Indeed, there is no harm," said she (and still with her
face showing her mortification that she was thus forced to
defend herself). "'Tis a young gentleman that is in some
trouble&mdash;his lodging near Bidford is also a hiding, as it
were&mdash;and&mdash;and I know but little of him beyond his name,
and that he is familiar with many of my father's friends in
London."</p>

<p>"And how comes it that you seek him out here alone?"
said he. "That is a becoming and maidenly thing!"</p>

<p>"I promised you I would tell you what I know of the
young gentleman," said she, with scornful lips. "I did
not promise to stand still and suffer your insolence."</p>

<p>"Insolence!" he exclaimed, as if her audacity bewildered
him.</p>

<p>"How know you that I sought him out?" she said, indignantly.
"May not one walk forth of a summer morning
without being followed by suspicious eyes&mdash;I warrant
me, eyes that are only too glad to suspect! To think evil
is an easy thing, it seems, with many; I wonder, sir, you
are not ashamed."</p>

<p>"You brave it out well," said he, sullenly; but it was
evident that her courage had impressed him, if it still left
him angered and suspicious.</p>

<p>And then he asked:</p>

<p>"How comes it that none of your friends or your family
know aught of this stranger?"</p>

<p>"I marvel you should speak of my family," she retorted.
"I had thought you were inclined to remain in ignorance
of them of late. But had you asked of Prudence Shawe
she might have told you something of this young gentleman;
or had you thought fit to call in at my grandmother's
cottage, you might perchance have found him seated there,
and a welcome guest at her board. Marry, 'tis easier far
to keep aloof and to think evil, as one may see."</p>

<p>And then she added:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, are you satisfied? May I go home without
farther threats?"</p>

<p>"I threatened you not, Judith," said he, rather more
humbly. "I would have my threats kept for those that
would harm you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>"I know of none such," she said, distinctly. "And as
for this young gentleman&mdash;that is in misfortune&mdash;such as
might happen to any one&mdash;and not only in hiding, but having
intrusted his secret to one or two of us that pity him
and see no harm in him&mdash;I say it were a cruel and unmanly
thing to spy out his concealment, or to spread the rumor
of his being in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Nay, you need not fear that of me, Judith," said he.
"Man to man is my way, when there is occasion. But can
you marvel if I would have you for your own sake avoid
any farther meetings with this stranger? If he be in hiding,
let him remain there, in God's name; I for one will
set no beagles to hunt him out. But as for you, I would
have you meddle with no such dangerous traps."</p>

<p>"Good sir," said she, "I have my conduct in my own
keeping, and can answer to those that have the guardianship
of me."</p>

<p>He did not reply to this rebuke. He said:</p>

<p>"May I walk back to the town with you, Judith?"</p>

<p>"You forget," she said, coldly, "that if we were seen together
the gossips might say I had come out hither to seek
you, and alone."</p>

<p>But he paid no heed to this taunt.</p>

<p>"I care not," said he, with an affectation of indifference,
"what the gossips in Stratford have to talk over. Stratford
and I are soon to part."</p>

<p>"What say you?" said she, quickly&mdash;and they were
walking on together now, the Don leisurely following at
their heels.</p>

<p>"Nay, 'tis nothing," said he, carelessly; "there are wider
lands beyond the seas, where a man can fight for his own
and hold it."</p>

<p>"And you?" she said. "You have it in your mind to
leave the country?"</p>

<p>"Marry, that have I!" said he, gayly. "My good friend
Daniel Hutt hath gotten together a rare regiment, and I
doubt not I shall be one of the captains of them ere many
years be over."</p>

<p>Her eyes were downcast, and he could not see what impression
this piece of news had made upon her&mdash;if, indeed,
he cared to look. They walked for some time in silence.</p>

<p>"It is no light matter," said she at length, and in rather
a low voice, "to leave one's native land."</p>

<p>"As for that," said he, "the land will soon be not worth
the living in. Why, in former times, men spoke of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>merry world of England. A merry world? I trow the canting
rogues of preachers have left but little merriment in it;
and now they would seek to have all in their power, and to
flood the land with their whining and psalm-singing, till we
shall have no England left us, but only a vast conventicle.
Think you that your father hath any sympathy with these?
I tell you no; I take it he is an Englishman, and not a
conventicle-man. 'Tis no longer the England of our forefathers
when men may neither hawk nor hunt, and women
are doomed to perdition for worshipping the false idol
starch, and the very children be called in from their games
of a Sunday afternoon. God-a-mercy, I have had enough
of Brother Patience-in-suffering, and his dominion of
grace!"</p>

<p>This seemed to Judith a strange reason for his going
away, for he had never professed any strong bias one way
or the other in these religious dissensions; his chief concern,
like that of most of the young men in Stratford, lying
rather in the direction of butt-shooting, or wrestling, or
having a romp with some of the wenches to the tune of
"Packington's Pound."</p>

<p>"Nay, as I hear," said he, "there be some of them in
such discontent with the King and the Parliament that
they even talk of transplanting themselves beyond seas,
like those that went to Holland: 'twere a goodly riddance
if the whole gang of the sour-faced hypocrites went, and
left to us our own England. And a fair beginning for the
new country across the Atlantic&mdash;half of them these Puritanical
rogues, with their fastings and preachments; and
the other half the constable's brats and broken men that
such as Hutt are drifting out: a right good beginning, if
they but keep from seizing each other by the throat in the
end! No matter: we should have our England purged of
the double scum!"</p>

<p>"But," said Judith, timidly, "methought you said you
were going out with these same desperate men?"</p>

<p>"I can take my life in my hand as well as another," said
he gloomily. And then he added: "They be none so desperate,
after all. Broken men there may be amongst them,
and many against whom fortune would seem to have a
spite; perchance their affairs may mend in the new country."</p>

<p>"But your affairs are prosperous," Judith said&mdash;though
she never once regarded him. "Why should you link
yourself with such men as these?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>"One must forth to see the world," said he; and he
went on to speak in a gay and reckless fashion of the life
that lay before him, and of its possible adventures and
hazards and prizes. "And what," said he, "if one were to
have good fortune in that far country, and become rich in
land, and have good store of corn and fields of tobacco;
what if one were to come back in twenty years' time to this
same town of Stratford, and set up for the trade of gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years?" said she, rather breathlessly. "'Tis
a long time; you will find changes."</p>

<p>"None that would matter much, methinks," said he, indifferently.</p>

<p>"There be those that will be sorry for your going away,"
she ventured to say&mdash;and she forced herself to think only
of Prudence Shawe.</p>

<p>"Not one that will care a cracked three-farthings!" was
the answer.</p>

<p>"You do ill to say so&mdash;indeed you do!" said she, with just
a touch of warmth in her tone. "You have many friends;
you serve them ill to say they would not heed your going."</p>

<p>"Friends?" said he. "Yes, they will miss me at the
shovel-board, or when there is one short at the catches."</p>

<p>"There be others than those," said she with some little
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Who, then?" said he.</p>

<p>"You should know yourself," she answered. "Think
you that Prudence, for one, will be careless as to your
leaving the country?"</p>

<p>"Prudence?" said he, and he darted a quick glance at
her. "Nay, I confess me wrong, then; for there is one
that hath a gentle heart, and is full of kindness."</p>

<p>"Right well I know that&mdash;for who should know better
than I?" said Judith. "As true a heart as any in Christendom,
and a prize for him that wins it, I warrant you.
If it be not won already," she added, quickly. "As to
that, I know not."</p>

<p>They were now nearing the town&mdash;they could hear the
dull sound of the mill, and before them was the church
spire among the trees, and beyond that the gray and red
huddled mass of houses, barns, and orchards.</p>

<p>"And when think you of going?" she said, after a
while.</p>

<p>"I know not, and I care not," said he, absently. "When
I spoke of my acquaintances being indifferent as to what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>might befall me, I did them wrong, for in truth there be
none of them as indifferent as I am myself."</p>

<p>"'Tis not a hopeful mood," said she, "to begin the making
of one's fortunes in a new country withal. I pray you,
what ails this town of Stratford, that you are not content?"</p>

<p>"It boots not to say, since I am leaving it," he answered.
"Perchance in times to come, when I am able to return to
it, I shall be better content. And you?"</p>

<p>"And I?" she repeated, with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Nay, you will be content enough," said he, somewhat
bitterly. "Mother Church will have a care of you. You
will be in the fold by then. The faithful shepherd will
have a charge over you, to keep you from communication
with the children of anger and the devil, that rage without
like lions seeking to destroy."</p>

<p>"I know not what you mean," said she, with a hot face.</p>

<p>"Right well you know," said he, coolly; but there was
an angry resentment running through his affected disdain
as he went on: "There be those that protest, and go forth
from the Church. And there be those that protest, and
remain within, eating the fat things, and well content with
the milk and the honey, and their stores of corn and oil.
Marry, you will be well provided for&mdash;the riches of the
next world laid up in waiting for you, and a goodly share
of the things of this world to beguile the time withal.
Nay, I marvel not; 'tis the wisdom of the serpent along
with the innocence of the dove. What matters the surplice,
the cross in baptism, and the other relics of popery,
if conformity will keep the larder full? Better that than
starvation in Holland, or seeking a home beyond the Atlantic,
where, belike, the children of the devil might prove
overrude companions. I marvel not, I; 'tis a foolish bird
that forsakes a warm nest."</p>

<p>And now she well knew against whom his bitter speech
was levelled; and some recollection of the slight he had
put upon her in the church-yard came into her mind,
with the memory that it had never been atoned for. And
she was astounded that he had the audacity to walk with
her now and here, talking as if he were the injured one.
The sudden qualm that had filled her heart when he spoke
of leaving the country was put aside; the kindly reference
to Prudence was forgotten; she only knew that this sarcasm
of his was very much out of place, and that this was
far from being the tone in which he had any right to address
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>"I know not," said she, stiffly, "what quarrel you may
have with this or that section of the Church; but it concerns
me not. I pray you attack those who are better
able to defend themselves than I am, or care to be. Methinks
your studies in that line have come somewhat
late."</p>

<p>"'Tis no greater marvel," said he, "than that you should
have joined yourself to the assembly of the saints; it was
not always so with you."</p>

<p>"I?" she said; but her cheeks were burning; for well
she knew that he referred to his having seen her with the
parson on that Sunday morning, and she was far too proud
to defend herself. "Heaven help me now, but I thought
I was mistress of my own actions!"</p>

<p>"In truth you are, Mistress Judith," said he, humbly
(and this was the first time that he had ever addressed her
so, and it startled her, for it seemed to suggest a final
separation between them&mdash;something as wide and irrevocable
as that twenty years of absence beyond the seas).
And then he said, "I crave your pardon if I have said
aught to offend you; and would take my leave."</p>

<p>"God be wi' you," said she, civilly; and then he left,
striking across the meadows toward the Bidford road, and,
as she guessed, probably going to seek his horse from
whomsoever he had left it with.</p>

<p>And as she went on, and into the town, she was wondering
what Prudence had said to him that should so suddenly
drive him to think of quitting the country. All had
seemed going well. As for Master Leofric Hope, his
secret was safe; this late companion of hers seemed to
have forgotten him altogether in his anger against the
good parson. And then she grew to think of the far land
across the ocean, that she had heard vaguely of from <span class="err" title="original: time time">time to
time</span>; to think how twenty years could be spent there:
and what Stratford would be like when that long space
was over.</p>

<p>"Twenty years," she said to herself, with a kind of sigh.
"There are many things will be settled, ere that time be
passed, for good or ill."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></h2>

<h3>A CONJECTURE.</h3>

<p>When she got back to New Place she found the house
in considerable commotion. It appeared that the famous
divine, Master Elihu Izod, had just come into the town,
being on his way toward Leicestershire, and that he had
been brought by the gentleman whose guest he was to
pay a visit to Judith's mother. Judith had remarked ere
now that the preachers and other godly persons who thus
honored the New Place generally made their appearance
a trifling time before the hour of dinner; and now, as she
reached the house, she was not surprised to find that
Prudence had been called in to entertain the two visitors&mdash;who
were at present in the garden&mdash;while within doors
her mother and the maids were hastily making such
preparations as were possible. To this latter work she
quickly lent a helping hand; and in due course of time
the board was spread with a copious and substantial repast,
not forgetting an ample supply of wine and ale for
those that were that way inclined. Then the two gentlemen
were called in, Prudence was easily persuaded to
stay, and, after a lengthened grace, the good preacher fell
to, seasoning his food with much pious conversation.</p>

<p>At such times Judith had abundant opportunities for
reverie, and for a general review of the situation of her
own affairs. In fact, on this occasion she seemed in a
manner to be debarred from participation in these informal
services at the very outset. Master Izod, who was
a tall, thin, dark, melancholy-visaged man&mdash;unlike his
companion, Godfrey Buller, of the Leas, near to Hinckley,
who, on the contrary, was a stout, yeoman-like person,
whose small gray absent eyes remained motionless
and vacant in the great breadth of his rubicund face&mdash;had
taken for his text, as it were, a list he had found somewhere
or other of those characters that were entitled to
command the admiration and respect of all good people.
These were: a young saint; an old martyr; a religious
soldier; a conscionable statesman; a great man courteous;
a learned man humble; a silent woman; a merry
companion without vanity; a friend not changed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>honor; a sick man cheerful; a soul departing with comfort
and assurance. And as Judith did not make bold to
claim to be any one of these&mdash;nor, indeed, to have any such
merits or excellences as would extort the approval of the
membership of the saints&mdash;she gradually fell away from
listening; and her mind was busy with other things; and
her imagination, which was vivid enough, intent upon
other scenes. One thing that had struck her the moment
she had returned was that Prudence seemed in an unusually
cheerful mood. Of course the arrival of two
visitors was an event in that quiet life of theirs; and no
doubt Prudence was glad to be appointed to entertain the
strangers&mdash;one of them, moreover, being of such great
fame. But so pleased was she, and so cheerful in her
manner, that Judith was straightway convinced there had
been no quarrel between her and Tom Quiney. Nay,
when was there time for that? He could scarcely have
seen her that morning; while the night before there had
certainly been no mention of his projected migration to
America, else Prudence would have said as much. What,
then, had so suddenly driven him to the conclusion that
England was no longer a land fit to live in? And why had
he paid Prudence such marked attention&mdash;why had he presented
her with the spaniel-gentle and offered her the emblazoned
missal&mdash;one evening, only to resolve the next
morning that he must needs leave the country? Nay, why
had he so unexpectedly broken the scornful silence with
which he had recently treated herself? He had given her
to understand that, as far as he was concerned, she did
not exist. He seemed determined to ignore her presence.
And yet she could not but remember that, if this contemptuous
silence on his part was broken by the amazement
of his seeing her in the company of a stranger, his
suspicions in that direction were very speedily disarmed.
A few words and they fled. It was his far more deadly
jealousy of the parson that remained; and was like to
remain, for she certainly would not stoop to explain that
the meeting in the church-yard was quite accidental. But
why should he trouble his head about either her or the
parson? Had he not betaken himself elsewhere&mdash;and
that with her right good-will? Nay, on his own confession
he had discovered how kind and gentle Prudence
was: there was a fit mate for him&mdash;one to temper the
wildness and hot-headedness of his youth. Judith had
never seen the sea, and therefore had never seen moonlight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>on the sea; but the nearest to that she could go, in thinking
of what Prudence's nature was like, in its restful and
sweet and serious beauty, was the moonlight she had seen
on the river Avon in the calm of a summer's night, the
water unbroken by a ripple, and not a whisper among
the reeds. Could he not perceive that too, and understand?</p>

<p>As for herself, she knew that she could at any moment
cut the knot of any complications that might arise by allowing
Master Walter to talk her over into marrying him.
Her father had assured her that the clear-headed and
energetic young parson was quite equal to that. Well, it
was about time she should abandon the frivolities and
coquetries of her youth; and her yielding would please
many good people, especially her mother and sister, and
obtain for herself a secure and established position, with
an end to all these quarrels and jealousies and uncertainties.
Moreover, there would be safety there. For, if the
truth must be told, she was becoming vaguely and uncomfortably
conscious that her relations with this young gentleman
who had come secretly into the neighborhood were
no longer what they had been at first. Their friendship
had ripened rapidly; for he was an audacious personage,
with plenty of self-assurance; and with all his professions
of modesty and deference, he seemed to know very well
that he could make his society agreeable. Then those
lines he had repeated: why, her face grew warm now as
she thought of them. She could not remember them
exactly, but she remembered their purport; and she remembered,
too, the emphasis with which he had declared
that the bonniest of our English roses were those that grew
in the country air. Now a young man cut off from his fellows
as he was might well be grateful for some little solace
of companionship, or for this or the other little bit of courtesy;
but he need not (she considered) show his gratitude just
in that way. Doubtless his flattery might mean little; the
town gentlemen, she understood, talked in that strain; and
perhaps it was only by an accident that the verses were
there in the book; but still she had the uneasy feeling
that there was something in his manner and speech that,
if encouraged, or suffered to continue without check,
might lead to embarrassment. That is to say, if she continued
to see him; and there was no need for that. She
could cut short this <span class="err" title="original: acquaintence">acquaintance</span> the moment she chose.
But on the one hand she did not wish to appear uncivil;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>and on the other she was anxious that he should see the
whole of this play that her father had written&mdash;thrown off,
as it were, amid the various cares and duties that occupied
his time. If Master Leofric Hope talked of Ben Jonson
when he came into the country, she would have him furnished
with something to say of her father when he returned
to town.</p>

<p>These were idle and wandering thoughts; and in one
respect they were not quite honest. In reality she was
using them to cloak and hide, or to drive from her mind
altogether, a suspicion that had suddenly occurred to her
that morning, and that had set her brain afire in a wild
way. It was not only the tune of "Green-sleeves" that
was in her head as she set off to walk home, though she
was trying to force herself to believe that. The fact is
this: when Master Leofric Hope made the pretty speech
about the country roses, he accompanied it, as has been
said, by a glance of only too outspoken admiration; and
there was something in this look&mdash;apart from the mere
flattery of it&mdash;that puzzled her. She was confused, doubtless;
but in her confusion it occurred to her that she had
met that regard somewhere before. She had no time to
pursue this fancy further; for in order to cover her embarrassment
she had betaken herself to the sheets in her
satchel; and thereafter she was so anxious that he should
think well of the play that all her attention was fixed on
that. But after leaving him, and having had a minute or
two to think over what had happened, she recalled that
look, and wondered why there should be something
strange in it. And then a startling fancy flashed across
her mind&mdash;the wizard! Was not that the same look&mdash;of
the same black eyes&mdash;that she had encountered up at the
corner of the field above the Weir Brake?&mdash;a glance of
wondering admiration, as it were? And if these two were
one and the same man? Of course that train, being lit,
ran rapidly enough: there were all kinds of parallels&mdash;in
the elaborate courtesy, in the suave voice, in the bold and
eloquent eyes. And she had no magical theory to account
for the transformation&mdash;it did not even occur to her
that the wizard could have changed himself into a young
man&mdash;there was no dismay or panic in that direction; she
instantly took it for granted that it was the young man
who had been personating the wizard. And why?&mdash;to
what end, if this bewildering possibility were to be regarded
for an instant? The sole object of the wizard's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>coming was to point out to her her future husband. And
if this young man were himself the wizard? A trick to
entrap her?</p>

<p>Ariel himself could not have flashed from place to place
more swiftly than this wild conjecture; but the next moment
she had collected herself. Her common-sense triumphed.
She bethought her of the young man she had
just left&mdash;of his respectful manners&mdash;of the letter he had
brought for her father&mdash;of the circumstances of his hiding.
It was not possible that he had come into the neighborhood
for the <span class="err" title="original: deliberare">deliberate</span> purpose of making a jest of
her. Did he look like one that would play such a trick;
that would name himself as her future husband; that
would cozen her into meeting him? She felt ashamed of
herself for harboring such a thought for a single instant.
Her wits had gone wool-gathering! Or was it that Prudence's
fears had so far got hold of her brain that she
could not regard the young man but as something other
than an ordinary mortal? In fair justice, she would dismiss
this absurd surmise from her mind forthwith; and so
she proceeded with her gathering of the flowers; and when
she did set forth for home, she had very nearly convinced
herself that there was nothing in her head but the tune of
"Green-sleeves." Nay, she was almost inclined to be
angry with Prudence for teaching her to be so suspicious.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, during this protracted dinner, while good
Master Izod was enlarging upon the catalogue of persons
worthy of honor and emulation, Judith was attacked once
more by the whisperings of the demon. For awhile she
fought against these, and would not admit to herself that
any further doubt remained in her mind; but when at
last, she found herself, despite herself, going back and
back to that possibility, she took heart of grace and
boldly faced it. What if it were true? Supposing him
to have adopted the disguise, and passed himself off as a
wizard, and directed her to the spot where she should
meet her future husband&mdash;what then? What ought she
to do? How ought she to regard such conduct? As an
idle frolic of youth? Or the device of one tired of the
loneliness of living at the farm, and determined at all hazards
to secure companionship? Or a darker snare still&mdash;with
what ultimate aims she could not divine? Or again
(for she was quite frank), if this were merely some one
who had seen her from afar, at church, or fair, or market,
and considered she was a good-looking maid, and wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>to have further acquaintance, and could think of no other
method than this audacious prank? She had heard of
lovers' stratagems in plenty; she knew of one or two of
such that had been resorted to in this same quiet town of
Stratford. And supposing that this last was the case,
ought she to be indignant? Should she resent his boldness
in hazarding such a stroke to win her? And then,
when it suddenly occurred to her that, in discussing this
possibility, she was calmly assuming that Master Leofric
Hope was in love with her&mdash;he never having said a word
in that direction, and being in a manner almost a stranger
to her&mdash;she told herself that no audacity on his part could
be greater than this on hers; and that the best thing she
could do would be to get rid once and forever of such unmaidenly
conjectures. No; she would go back to her
original position. The facts of the case were simple
enough. He would have brought no letter to her father
had he been bent on any such fantastic enterprise. Was
it likely he would suffer the thraldom of that farm-house,
and live away from his friends and companions, for the
mere chance of a few minutes' occasional talk with a
Stratford wench? As for the similarity between his look
and that of the wizard, the explanation lay no doubt in
her own fancy, which had been excited by Prudence's superstitious
fears. And if in his courtesy he had applied
to herself the lines written by the young Devonshire poet&mdash;well,
that was but a piece of civility and kindness, for
which she ought to be more than usually grateful, seeing
that she had not experienced too much of that species of
treatment of late from one or two of her would-be suitors.</p>

<p>She was awakened from these dreams by the conversation
suddenly ceasing; and in its place she heard the more
solemn tones of the thanksgiving offered up by Master Izod:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The God of glory and peace, who hath created, redeemed,
and presently fed us, be blessed forever and ever.
So be it. The God of all power, who hath called from
death that great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, comfort
and defend the flock which he hath redeemed by the
blood of the eternal testament; increase the number of
true preachers; repress the rage of obstinate tyrants;
mitigate and lighten the hearts of the ignorant; relieve
the pains of such as be afflicted, but specially of those that
suffer for the testimony of thy truth; and finally, confound
Satan by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>And then, as the travellers were continuing their journey
forthwith, they proposed to leave; and Master Buller
expressed his sorrow that Judith's father had not been at
home to have made the friendship of a man so famous as
Master Izod; and the good parson, in his turn, as they
departed, solemnly blessed the house and all that dwelt
therein, whether present or absent. As soon as they were
gone, Judith besought her mother for the key of the summer-house,
for she wished to lay on her father's table the
wild flowers she had brought; and having obtained it, she
carried Prudence with her into the garden, and there they
found themselves alone, for goodman Matthew had gone
home for his dinner.</p>

<p>"Dear mouse," said she, quickly, "what is it hath happened
to Tom Quiney?"</p>

<p>"I know not, Judith," the other said, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"It is in his mind to leave the country."</p>

<p>"I knew not that."</p>

<p>"I dare be sworn you did not, sweetheart," said she,
"else surely you would have told me. But why? What
drives him to such a thing? His business prospers well,
as I hear them say; and yet must he forsake it for the
company of those desperate men that are going away to
fight the Indians beyond seas. Nothing will content him.
England is no longer England; Stratford is no longer
Stratford. Mercy on us, what is the meaning of it all?"</p>

<p>"In truth I know not, Judith."</p>

<p>Then Judith regarded her.</p>

<p>"Good cousin, I fear me you gave him but a cold welcome
yesternight."</p>

<p>"I welcomed him as I would welcome any of my brother's
friends," said Prudence, calmly and without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"But you do not understand," Judith said, with a touch
of impatience. "Bless thy heart! young men are such
strange creatures; and must have all to suit their humors;
and are off and away in their peevish fits if you do not entertain
them, and cringe, and say your worship to every
sirrah of them! Oh, they be mighty men of valor in their
own esteem; and they must have us poor handmaidens do
them honor; and if all be not done to serve, 'tis boot and
spur and off to the wars with them, and many a fine tale
thereafter about the noble ladies that were kind to them
abroad. Marry! they can crow loud enough; 'tis the poor
hens that durst never utter a word; and all must give way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>before his worship! What, then? What did you do? Was
not the claret to his liking? Did not your brother offer
him a pipe of Trinidado?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Judith, it cannot be through aught that happened
last night, if he be speaking of leaving the country,"
Prudence said. "I thought he was well content, and right
friendly in his manner."</p>

<p>"But you do not take my meaning," Judith said. "Dear
heart, bear me no ill-will; but I would have you a little
more free with your favors. You are too serious, sweet
mouse. Could you not pluck up a little of the spirit that
the pretty Rosalind showed&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;when
she was teasing Orlando in the forest? In truth these
men are fond of a varying mood; when they play with a
kitten they like to know it has claws. And again, if you
be too civil with them, they presume, and would become
the master all at once; and then must everything be done
to suit their lordships' fantasies, or else 'tis up and away
with them, as this one goes."</p>

<p>"I pray you, Judith," her friend said, and now in great
embarrassment, "forbear to speak of such things: in truth,
my heart is not set that way. Right well I know that if
he be leaving the country, 'tis through no discontent with
me, nor that he would heed in any way how I received
him. Nay, 'tis far otherwise; it is no secret whom he
would choose for wife. If you are sorry to hear of his
going away from his home, you know that a word from
you would detain him."</p>

<p>"Good mouse, the folly of such thoughts!" Judith exclaimed.
"Why, when he will not even give me a 'Good-day
to you, wench'!"</p>

<p>"You best know what reasons he had for his silence,
Judith; I know not."</p>

<p>"Reasons?" said she, with some quick color coming to
her face. "We will let that alone, good gossip. I meddle
not with any man's reasons, if he choose to be uncivil
to me; God help us, the world is wide enough for all!"</p>

<p>"Did you not anger him, Judith, that he is going away
from his home and his friends?"</p>

<p>"Anger him? Perchance his own suspicions have angered
him," was the answer; and then she said, in a gentler
tone: "But in truth, sweetheart, I hope he will change
his mind. Twenty years&mdash;for so he speaks&mdash;is a long
space to be away from one's native land; there would be
many changes ere he came back. Twenty years, he said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>Judith rather timidly looked at her companion, but indeed
there was neither surprise nor dismay depicted on
the pale and gentle face. Her eyes were absent, it is true,
but they did not seem to crave for sympathy.</p>

<p>"'Tis strange," said she. "He said naught of such a
scheme last night, though he and Julius spoke of this very
matter of the men who were preparing to cross the seas.
I know not what can have moved him to such a purpose."</p>

<p>"Does he imagine, think you," said Judith, "that we
shall all be here awaiting him at the end of twenty years,
and as we are now? Or is he so sure of his own life?
They say there is great peril in the new lands they have
taken possession of beyond sea, and that there will be
many a bloody fight ere they can reap the fruit of their
labors in peace. Nay, I will confess to thee, sweet mouse,
I like not his going. Old friends are old friends, even if
they have wayward humors; and fain would I have him
remain with us here in Stratford&mdash;ay, and settled here,
moreover, with a sweet Puritan wife by his side, that at
present must keep everything hidden. Well no matter,"
she continued, lightly. "I seek no secrets&mdash;except those
that be in the oaken box within here."</p>

<p>She unlocked the door of the summer-house, and entered,
and put the flowers on the table. "Tell me, Prue,"
said she, "may we venture to take some more of the play,
or must I wait till I have put back the other sheets?"</p>

<p>"You have not put them back?"</p>

<p>"In truth, no," said Judith, carelessly. "I lent them to
the young gentleman, Leofric Hope."</p>

<p>"Judith!" her friend exclaimed, with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"To one you know nothing of? You have parted with
these sheets&mdash;that are so valuable?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, good mouse," said she; "you know the
sheets are cast away as useless. And I but lent them to
him for an hour or two to lighten the tedium of his solitude.
Nor was that all, good Prue, if I must tell thee the
truth; I would fain have him know that my father can do
something worth speaking of as well as his friend Ben
Jonson, and perchance even better; what think you?"</p>

<p>"You have seen him again, then&mdash;this morning?"</p>

<p>"Even so," Judith answered, calmly.</p>

<p>"Judith, why would you run into such danger?" her
friend said, in obvious distress. "In truth I know not
what 'twill come to. And now there is this farther bond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>in this secret commerce&mdash;think you that all this can
remain unknown? Your meeting with him must come to
some one's knowledge&mdash;indeed it must, sweetheart."</p>

<p>"Nay, but this time you have hit the mark," <span class="err" title="should be: said Judith, complacently">complacently</span>.
"If you would assure yourself, good Prue, that
the young gentleman is no grisly ghost or phantom, methinks
you could not do better than ask Tom Quiney, who
saw him this very morning&mdash;and saw us speaking together,
as I guess."</p>

<p>"He saw you!" Prudence exclaimed. "And what said
he?"</p>

<p>"He talked large and wild for a space," said Judith,
coolly, "but soon I persuaded him there was no great
harm in the stranger gentleman. In sooth his mind was
so full of his own affairs&mdash;and so bitter against all preachers,
ministers, and pastors&mdash;and he would have it that
England was no longer fit to live in&mdash;marry, he told me so
many things in so few minutes that I have half forgotten
them!"</p>

<p>And then it suddenly occurred to her that this fantasy
that had entered her mind in the morning, and that had
haunted her during Master Elihu Izod's discourse, would
be an excellent thing with which to frighten Prudence.
'Twas but a chimera, she assured herself; but there was
enough substance in it for that. And so, when she had
carefully arranged the flowers on the table, and cast another
longing look at the oaken chest, she locked the door
of the summer-house, and put her arm within the arm of
her friend, and led her away for a walk in the garden.</p>

<p>"Prudence," said she, seriously, "I would have you
give me counsel. Some one hath asked me what a young
maiden should do in certain circumstances that I will put
before you; but how can I tell, how can I judge of anything,
when my head is in a whirligig of confusion with
parsons' arguments, and people leaving the country, and I
know not what else? But you, good mouse&mdash;your mind
is ever calm and equable&mdash;you can speak sweet words in
Israel&mdash;you are as Daniel that was so excellent a judge
even in his youth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judith!" the other protested; but indeed Judith's eyes
were perfectly grave and apparently sincere.</p>

<p>"Well, then, sweetheart, listen: let us say that a young
man has seen a young maiden that is not known to him
but by name&mdash;perchance at church it may have been, or as
she was walking home to her own door. And there may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>be reasons why he should not go boldly to her father's
house, though he would fain do so; his fancy being taken
with her in a small measure, and he of a gentle disposition,
and ready to esteem her higher than she deserved. And
again it might be that he wished for private speech with
her&mdash;to judge of her manners and her inclinations&mdash;before
coming publicly forward to pay court to her: but alack, I
cannot tell the story as my father would; 'tis the veriest
skeleton of a story, and I fear me you will scarce understand.
But let us say that the young man is bold and ingenious,
and bethinks him of a stratagem whereby to make
acquaintance with the damsel. He writes to her as a wizard
that has important news to tell her; and begs her to
go forth and meet him; and that on a certain morning he
will be awaiting her at such and such a place. Now this
maiden that I am telling you of has no great faith in wizards,
but being curious to see the juggling, she goes forth
to meet him as he asks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judith, I pray you speak plain; what is't you mean?"
Prudence exclaimed; for she had begun to suspect.</p>

<p>"You must listen, good mouse, before you can give
judgment," said Judith, calmly; and she proceeded:
"Now you must understand that it was the young gentleman
himself whom she met, though she knew it not; for
he had dressed himself up as an ancient wizard, and he had
a solemn manner, and Latin speech, and what not. Then
says the wizard to her, 'I can show you the man that is to
be your lover and sweetheart and husband; that will win
you and wear you in the time coming; and if you would
see him, go to such and such a cross-road, and he will appear.'
Do you perceive, now, sweet mouse, that it was a
safe prophecy, seeing that he had appointed himself to be
the very one who should meet her?"</p>

<p>Prudence had gradually slipped her arm away from that
of her friend, and now stood still, regarding her breathlessly,
while Judith, with eyes quite placid and inscrutable,
continued her story:</p>

<p>"'Twas a noteworthy stratagem, and successful withal;
for the maiden goes to the cross-road, and there she meets
the young gentleman&mdash;now in his proper costume. But
she has no great faith in magic; she regards him not as a
ghost summoned by the wizard; she would rather see in
this meeting an ordinary accident; and the young man
being most courteous and modest and civil-spoken, they
become friends. Do you follow the story? You see, good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>mouse, there is much in his condition to demand sympathy
and kindness&mdash;he being in hiding, and cut off from his
friends; and she, not being too industrious, and fond rather
of walking in the meadows and the like, meets him now
here, now there, but with no other thought than friendliness.
I pray you, bear that in mind, sweetheart; for
though I esteem her not highly, yet would I do her justice:
there was no thought in her mind but friendliness, and a
wish to be civil to one that seemed grateful for any such
communion. And then one morning something happens&mdash;beshrew
me if I can tell thee how it happened, and that
is the truth&mdash;but something happens&mdash;an idea jumps into
her head&mdash;she suspects that this young gentleman is no
other than the same who was the wizard, and that she has
been entrapped by him, and that he, having played the
wizard, would now fain play the lover&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judith, is't possible! is't possible!"</p>

<p>"Hold, cousin, hold; your time is not yet. I grant you
'tis a bold conjecture, and some would say not quite seemly
and becoming to a maiden, seeing that he had never
spoken any word to her of the kind; but there it was in
her head&mdash;the suspicion that this young gentleman had
tricked her, for his own amusement, or perchance to secure
her company. Now, sweet judge in Israel, for your
judgment! And on two points, please you. First supposing
this conjecture to be false, how is she to atone to
the young gentleman? And how is she to punish herself?
And how is she to be anything but uneasy should she
chance to see him again? Nay, more, how is she to get
this evil suspicion banished from her mind, seeing that she
dare not go to him and confess, and beg him for the assurance
that he had never heard of the wizard? Then the
second point: supposing the conjecture to be true, ought
she to be very indignant? How should she demean herself?
Should she go to him and reproach him with his
treachery? She would never forgive it, dear mouse, would
she, even as a lover's stratagem?"</p>

<p>"Judith, I cannot understand you; I cannot understand
how you can even regard such a possibility, and remain
content and smiling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I ought to be indignant? Good cousin, I but
asked for your advice," Judith said. "I must be angry;
I must fret and fume, and use hot language, and play the
tragedy part? In good sooth, when I think on't, 'twas a
piece of boldness to put himself forward as my future husband&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>was indeed&mdash;though twas cunningly contrived.
Marry, but I understand now why my goodman wizard
would take no money from me; 'twas myself that he would
have in payment of his skill; and 'gracious lady' and
'sweet lady,' these were the lures to lead me on; and his
shepherd's dial placed on the ground! Then off go beard
and cloak, and a couple of days thereafter he is a gay
young gallant; and 'sweet lady' it is again&mdash;or 'fair lady,'
was't?&mdash;'know you one Master Shakespeare in the town?'
And such modesty, and such downcast eyes, and an appeal
for one in misfortune. Heaven save us, was it not well
done? Modesty! By my life, a rare modest gentleman!
He comes down to Stratford, armed with his London
speech and his London manners, and he looks around.
Which one, then? which of all the maidens will his lordship
choose for wife? 'Oh!' saith he, 'there is Judith
Shakespeare; she will do as well as another; perchance
better, for New Place is the fairest house in the town,
and doubtless she will have a goodly marriage portion.
So now how to secure her? how to charm her away from
any clownish sweetheart she may chance to have? Easily
done, i' faith! A country wench is sure to believe in
magic; 'tis but raising my own ghost out of the ground,
and a summons to her, and I have her sure and safe, to
win and to wear, for better or worse!'" She looked at
Prudence. "Heaven's blessings on us all, good Prue, was
there ever poor maiden played such a scurril trick?"</p>

<p>"Then your eyes are opened, Judith?" said Prudence,
eagerly; "you will have naught more to do with such a
desperate villain?"</p>

<p>Again Judith regarded her, and laughed.</p>

<p>"I but told a story to frighten thee, good heart," said
she. "A desperate villain? Yes, truly; but 'tis I am a
desperate villain to let such rascal suspicions possess me
for an instant. Nay, good mouse, think of it! Is't possible
that one would dare so much for so poor a prize?
That the young gentleman hath some self-assurance, I
know; and he can quickly make friends; but do you think,
if any such dark design had been his, he would have entered
my grandmother's cottage, and ate and drank there, and
promised to renew his visit? Sweet judge in Israel, your
decision on the other point, I pray you! What penance
must I do for letting such cruel thoughts stray into my
brain? How shall I purge them away? To whom must
I confess? Nay, methinks I must go to the young gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>himself, and say: 'Good sir, I have a friend and gossip
that is named Prudence Shawe, who hath a strange belief
in phantom-men and conspirators. I pray you pardon
me that through her my brain is somewhat distraught; and
that I had half a mind to accuse you of a plot for stealing
me away&mdash;me, who have generally this stout mastiff with
me. I speech you, sir, steal me not&mdash;nay, forgive me that
I ever dreamed of your having any such purpose. 'Tis our
rude country manners, good sir, that teach a maid to believe
a man may not speak to her without intent to marry
her. I pray you pardon me&mdash;my heart is kneeling to you,
could you but see&mdash;and give me such assurance that you
meditated no such thing as will bring me back my scattered
senses.' Were not that well done? Shall that be my penance,
good mouse?"</p>

<p>"Dear Judith, tell me true," her friend said, almost
piteously, "do you suspect him of having played the wizard
to cheat you and entrap you?"</p>

<p>"Good cousin," said she, in her frankest manner, "I
confess: I did suspect&mdash;for an instant. I know not what
put it into my head. But sure I am I have done him wrong&mdash;marry,
'twere no such deadly sin even had he been guilty
of such a trick; but I believe it not&mdash;nay, he is too civil
and gentle for a jest of the kind. When I see him again I
must make him amends for my evil thinking: do not I owe
him as much, good gossip?"</p>

<p>This was all she could say at present, for Matthew
gardener here made his appearance, and that was the signal
for their withdrawing into the house. But that afternoon,
as Judith bethought her that Master Leofric Hope
would be coming to her grandmother's cottage with the
manuscript he had promised to return, she became more
and more anxious to see him again. Somehow she thought
she could more effectually drive away this disquieting surmise
if she could but look at him, and regard his manner,
and hear him speak. As it turned out, however, it was not
until somewhat late on in the evening that she found time
to seek out little Willie Hart, and propose to him that he
should walk with her as far as Shottery.</p>

<h3>A DAUGHTER OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>"Sweetheart Willie," she said&mdash;and her hand lay lightly
on his shoulder, as they were walking through the meadows
in the quiet of this warm golden evening&mdash;"what mean
you to be when you grow up?"</p>

<p>He thought for a second or two, and then he rather timidly
regarded her.</p>

<p>"What would you have me to be, Cousin Judith?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why, then," said she, "methinks I would have you be
part student and part soldier, were it possible, like the
gallant Sir Philip Sidney, that Queen Elizabeth said was
the jewel of her reign. And yet you know, sweetheart,
that we cannot all of us be of such great estate. There
be those who live at the court, and have wealth and lands,
and expeditions given them to fit out, so that they gain
fame; that is not the lot of every one, and I know not
whether it may be yours&mdash;though for brave men there is
ever a chance. But this I know I would have you ready
to do, whether you be in high position or in low, and that
is to fight for England, if needs be, and defend her, and
cherish her. Why," she said, "what would you think, now,
of one brought up by a gentle mother, one that owes his
birth and training to this good mother, and because there
is something amiss in the house, and because everything
is not to his mind, he ups and says he must go away and
forsake her? Call you that the thought of a loyal son and
one that is grateful? I call it the thought of a peevish,
froward, fractious child. Because, forsooth, this thing or
the other is not to his worship's liking, or all the company
not such as he would desire, or others of the family having
different opinions&mdash;as surely, in God's name, they have a
right to have&mdash;why, he must needs forsake the mother
that bore him, and be off and away to other countries!
Sweetheart Willie, that shall never be your mind, I charge
you. No, you shall remain faithful to your mother England,
that is a dear mother and a good mother, and hath
done well by her sons and daughters for many a hundred
years; and you shall be proud of her, and ready to fight
for her, ay, and to give your life for the love of her, if ever
the need should be!"</p>

<p>He was a small lad, but he was sensitive and proud-spirited;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>and he loved dearly this Cousin Judith who had
made this appeal to him; so that for a second the blood
seemed to forsake his face.</p>

<p>"I am too young as yet to do aught, Cousin Judith,"
said he, in rather a low voice, for his breath seemed to
catch; "but&mdash;but when I am become a man I know that
there will be one that will sooner die than see any Spaniard
or Frenchman seize the country."</p>

<p>"Bravely said, sweetheart, by my life!" she exclaimed
(and her approval was very sweet to his ears). "That is
the spirit that women's hearts love to hear of, I can tell
thee." And she stooped and kissed him in reward. "Hold
to that faith. Be not ashamed of your loyalty to your
mother England! Ashamed? Heaven's mercy! where is
there such another country to be proud of? And where
is there another mother that hath bred such a race of sons?
Why, times without number have I heard my father say
that neither Greece, nor Rome, nor Carthage, nor any of
them, were such a race of men as these in this small island,
nor had done such great things, nor earned so great a fame,
in all parts of the world and beyond the seas. And mark
you this, too: 'tis the men who are fiercest to fight with
men that are the gentlest to women; they make no slaves
of their women; they make companions of them; and in
honoring them they honor themselves, as I reckon. Why,
now, could I but remember what my father hath written
about England, 'twould stir your heart, I know; that it
would; for you are one of the true stuff, I'll be sworn;
and you will grow up to do your duty by your gracious
mother England&mdash;not to run away from her in peevish
discontent!"</p>

<p>She cast about for some time, her memory, that she could
not replenish by any book-reading, being a large and somewhat
miscellaneous store-house.</p>

<p>"'Twas after this fashion," said she, "if I remember
aright:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fortress, built by Nature for herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against infestion and the hand of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This happy breed of men, this little world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This precious stone set in the silver sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which serves it in the office of a wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as a moat defensive to a house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the envy of less happier lands&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>Mark you that, sweetheart?&mdash;is't not a land worth fighting
for? Ay, and she hath had sons that could fight for her;
and she hath them yet, I dare be sworn, if the need were
to arise. And this is what you shall say, Cousin Willie,
when you are a man and grown:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come the three corners of the world in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall shock them. Naught shall make us rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If England to itself do rest but true!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These quotations were but for the instruction of this
small cousin of hers, and yet her own face was proud.</p>

<p>"Shall I be a soldier, then, Cousin Judith?" the boy
said. "I am willing enough. I would be what you would
wish me to be; and if I went to the wars, you would never
have need to be ashamed of me."</p>

<p>"That know I right well, sweetheart," said she, and she
patted him on the head. "But 'tis not every one's duty
to follow that calling. You must wait and judge for yourself.
But whatever chances life may bring you, this must
you ever remain, if you would have my love, sweetheart,
and that I hope you shall have always&mdash;you must remain
a good and loyal son to your mother England, one not
easily discontented with small discomforts, and sent forth
in a peevish fit. Where is there a fairer country? Marry,
I know of none. Look around&mdash;is't not a fair enough
country?"</p>

<p>And fair indeed on this quiet evening was that wide
stretch of Warwickshire, with its hedges and green meadows,
and low-lying wooded hills bathed in the warm sunset
light. But it was the presence of Judith that made
it all magical and mystical to him. Whatever she regarded
with her clear-shining and wondrous eyes was beautiful
enough for him&mdash;while her hand lay on his shoulder or
touched his hair. He was a willing pupil. He drank in
those lessons in patriotism: what was it he would not do
for his cousin Judith? What was it he would not believe
if it were she who told him, in that strange voice of hers,
that thrilled him, and was like music to him, whether she
spoke to him in this proud, admonitory way, or was in a
teasing mood, or was gentle and affectionate toward him?
Yes, this Warwickshire landscape was fair enough, under
the calm sunset sky; but he knew not what made it all so
mystical and wonderful, and made the far golden clouds
seem as the very gateways to heaven.</p>

<p>"Or is there one with a prouder story?" she continued.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>"Or a land of greater freedom? Why, look at me, now.
Here am I, a woman, easily frightened, helpless if there
were danger, not able to fight any one. Why, you yourself,
Cousin Willie, if you were to draw a dagger on me,
I declare to thee I would run and shriek and hide. Well,
look at me as I stand here: all the might and majesty of
England cannot harm me; I am free to go or to stay.
What needs one more? None durst put a hand on me.
My mind is as free as my footsteps. I may go this way
or that as I choose; and no one may command me to believe
this, that, or the other. What more? And this security&mdash;think
you it had not to be fought for?&mdash;think you
it was not worth the fighting for? Or think you we should
forget to give good thanks to the men that faced the Spaniards,
and drove them by sea and shore, and kept our England
to ourselves? Or think you we should forget our
good Queen Bess, that I warrant me had as much spirit
as they, and was as much a man as any of them?"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Perchance you never heard, sweetheart, of the answer
that she made to the Spanish ambassador?"</p>

<p>"No, Judith," said he, but something in her manner
told him that there had been no cowardice in that answer.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I will tell thee the story of what happened
at Deptford. And now I bethink me, this must
you do, cousin Willie, when you are grown to be a man;
and whether you be soldier or sailor, or merchant, or student,
'tis most like that some day or other you will be in
London; and then must you not fail to go straightway to
Deptford to see the famous ship of Sir Francis Drake lying
there. I tell thee, 'twas a goodly thought to place it
there; that was like our brave Queen Bess; she would
have the youth of the country regard with honor the ship
that had been all round the world, and chased the Spaniards
from every sea. Nay, so bad is my memory that I
cannot recall the name of the vessel&mdash;perchance 'twas the
Judith&mdash;at least I have heard that he had one of that
name; but there it lies, to signal the glory of England
and the routing of Spain."</p>

<p>"The Judith?" said he, with wondering eyes. "Did
he name the ship after you, cousin?"</p>

<p>"Bless the lad! All that I'm going to tell thee happened
ere I was born."</p>

<p>"No matter," said he, stoutly: "the first thing I will
ask to see, if ever I get to London is that very ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>"Well, then, the story," she continued, shaping the
thing in her mind (for being entirely destitute of book
learning, historical incidents were apt to assume a dramatic
form in her imagination, and also to lose literal accuracy
of outline). "You must know the Spaniards were
sore vexed because of the doings of Francis Drake in all
parts of the world, for he had plundered and harried them
and burned their ships and their towns, and made the very
name of England a terror to them. 'Tis no marvel if they
wished to get hold of him; and they declared him to be no
better than a pirate; and they would have the Queen&mdash;that
is, our last Queen&mdash;deliver him over to them that they
might do with him what they willed. Marry, 'twas a bold
demand to <span class="err" title="should be: make">made</span> of England! And the Queen, how does
she take it, think you?&mdash;how is she moved to act in such
a pass? Why, she goes down to Deptford, to this very
ship that I told thee of&mdash;she and all her nobles and ladies,
for they would see the famous ship. Then they had dinner
on board, as I have heard the story; and the Queen's
Majesty asked many particulars of his voyages from Master
Drake, and received from him certain jewels as a gift, and
was right proud to wear them. Then says she aloud to
them all: 'My lords, is this the man the Spaniards would
have me give over to them?' Right well she knew he
was the man; but that was her way, and she would call
the attention of all of them. 'Your Majesty,' they said, ''tis
no other.' Then she swore a great oath that the Queen
of England knew how to make answer to such a demand.
'Come hither, Master Drake,' says she, in a terrible voice.
'Kneel!' Then he knelt on his knee before her. 'My
lord,' says she to one of the noblemen standing by, 'your
sword!' And then, when she had the sword in her hand,
she says, in a loud voice, 'My lords, this is the man that
Spain would have us give up to her; and this is the answer
of England: Arise, Sir Francis!'&mdash;and with that she
taps him on the shoulder&mdash;which is the way of making a
knight, Cousin Willie; and I pray you may be brave and
valiant, and come to the same dignity, so that all of us
here in Stratford shall say, 'There, now, is one that knew
how to serve faithfully his fair mother England!' But
that was not all, you must know, that happened with regard
to Sir Francis Drake. For the Spanish ambassador
was wroth with the Queen; ay, and went the length even
of speaking with threats. ''Twill come to the cannon,'
says he. 'What?' says she, turning upon him. 'Your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>Majesty,' says he, 'I fear me this matter will come to the
cannon.' And guess you her answer?&mdash;nay, they say she
spoke quite calmly, and regarded him from head to foot,
and that if there were anger in her heart there was none
in her voice. 'Little man, little man,' says she, 'if I hear
any more such words from thee, by God I will clap thee
straight into a dungeon!'"</p>

<p>Judith laughed, in a proud kind of way.</p>

<p>"That was the answer that England gave," said she,
"and that she is like to give again, if the Don or any
other of them would seek to lord it over her."</p>

<p>Three-fourths of these details were of her own invention, or
rather&mdash;for it is scarcely fair to say that&mdash;they had
unconsciously grown up in her mind from the small seed
of the true story. But little Willie Hart had no distrust
of any legend that his cousin Judith might relate to him.
Whatever Judith said was true, and also luminous in a
strange kind of fashion; something beautiful and full of
color, to be thought over and pondered over. And now as
they walked along toward the village, idly and lazily enough&mdash;for
she had no other errand than to fetch back the manuscript
that would be lying at the cottage&mdash;his eyes were
wistful. His fancies were far away. What was it, then,
that he was to do for England&mdash;that Judith should approve
in the after-years? And for how long should he be away&mdash;in
the Spanish Main, perchance, of which he had heard many
stories, or fighting in the lowlands of Holland, or whatever
he was called to do&mdash;and what was there at the end? Well,
the end that he foresaw and desired&mdash;the reward of all his toil&mdash;was
nothing more nor less than this: that he should be
sitting once again in a pew in Stratford church, on a
quiet Sunday morning, with Judith beside him as of old,
they listening to the singing together. He did not think
of his being grown up, or that she would be other than she
was now. His mind could form no other or fairer consummation
than that&mdash;that would be for him the final good&mdash;to
come back to Stratford town to find Judith as she had
ever been to him, gentle, and kind, and soft-handed, and
ready with a smile from her beautiful and lustrous eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sweetheart Willie," said she, as they were nearing
the cottages, "look at the quiet that reigns all around,
and no priests of the Inquisition to come dragging my poor
old grandmother from her knitting. What has she to do
but look after the garden, and scold the maid, and fetch
milk for the cat? And all this peace of the land that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>enjoy we may have to fight for again; and then, if the
King's Majesty calls either for men or for money, you shall
have no word but obedience. Heard you never of the
Scotch knight, Sir Patrick Spens?&mdash;that the Scotch King
would send away to Norroway at an evil time of the year?
Did he grumble? Did he say his men were ill content to
start at such a time? Nay, as I have heard, when he read
the King's letter the tears welled in his eyes; but I'll be
sworn that was for the companions he was taking with
him to face the cruel sea.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The King's daughter from Norroway,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis we must fetch her home,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">he says; and then they up with their sails, and set out
from the land that they never were to see more. What of
that? They were brave men; they did what was demanded
of them; though the black seas of the north were
too strong for them in the end. 'Twas a sad tale, in good
sooth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O lang, lang may the ladies sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wi' the fans into their hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they see Sir Patrick Spens<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come sailing to the strand!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And lang, lang may the maidens sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wi' their gold combs in their hair,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Half owre, half owre to Aberdour,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there lies good Sir Patrick Spens<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wi' the Scots lords at his feet.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">But what then? I tell thee, sweetheart, any maiden that
would be worth the winning would a hundred times liefer
wail for a lover that had died bravely than welcome him back
safe and sound as a coward. You shall be no coward, I warrant
me, when you are grown up to be a man; and above
all, as I say, shall you be gentle and forgiving with your
mother England, even if your own condition be not all
you wish; and none the less for that shall you be willing
to fight for her should she be in trouble. Nay, I'll answer
for thee, lad: I know thee well."</p>

<p>"But, Judith," said he, "who are they you speak of,
that are discontented, and would go away and leave the
country?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p><p>Well, it is probable she might have found some embarrassment
in answering this question (if she had been
pressed to name names) but that what she now beheld deprived
her of the power of answering altogether. She had
come over from the town with no other thought than to
pay a brief visit to her grandmother, and fetch back the
portion of the play, and she had not the slightest expectation
of encountering Master Leofric Hope. But there unmistakably
he was, though he did not see her, for he was
standing at the gate of her grandmother's cottage, and
talking to the old dame, who was on the other side. There
was no pretence of concealment. Here he was in the
public path, idly chatting, his hand resting on the gate.
And as Judith had her cousin Willie with her, her first
thought was to hurry away in any direction in order to
escape an interview; but directly she saw that this was
impossible, for her grandmother had descried her, if
Leofric Hope had not. The consequence was that, as she
went forward to the unavoidable meeting, she was not
only surprised and a trifle confused and anxious, but also
somewhat and vaguely resentful; for she had been intending,
before seeing him again, to frame in her mind certain
tests which might remove or confirm one or two suspicions
that had caused her disquietude. And now&mdash;and unfairly,
as she thought&mdash;she found herself compelled to meet him
without any such legitimate safeguard of preparation. She
had no time to reflect that it was none of his fault. Why
had not he left the play earlier? she asked herself. Why
had not he departed at once? Why, with all his professions
of secrecy, should he be standing in the open highway,
carelessly talking? And what was she to say to little
Willie Hart that would prevent his carrying back the tale
to the school and the town? When she went forward, it
was with considerable reluctance; and she had a dim, hurt
sense of having been imposed upon, or somehow or another
injured.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>VARYING MOODS.</h3>

<p>But the strange thing was that the moment he turned
and saw her&mdash;and the moment she met the quick look of
friendliness and frank admiration that came into his face
and his eloquent dark eyes&mdash;all her misgivings, surmises,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>suspicions, and half-meditated safeguards instantly vanished.
She herself could not have explained it; she only
knew that, face to face with him, she had no longer any
doubt as to his honesty; and consequently that vague
sense of injury vanished also. She had been taken unawares,
but she did not mind. Everything, indeed, connected
with this young man was of a startling, unusual
character; and she was becoming familiar with that, and
less resentful at being surprised.</p>

<p>"Ah, fair Mistress Judith," said he, "you come opportunely:
I would thank you from the heart for the gracious
company I have enjoyed this afternoon through your good-will;
in truth, I was loath to part with such sweet friends,
and perchance detained them longer than I should."</p>

<p>"I scarce understand you, sir," said she, somewhat bewildered.</p>

<p>"Not the visions that haunt a certain magic island?"
said he.</p>

<p>Her face lit up.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" she asked, with a kind of pride; but at
this point her grandmother interposed, and insisted&mdash;somewhat
to Judith's surprise&mdash;that they should come in and
sit down, if not in the house, at least in the garden. He
seemed willing enough; for without a word he opened
the gate to let Judith pass; and then she told him who
her cousin was; and in this manner they went up to the
little arbor by the hedge.</p>

<p>"Well, good sir, and how liked you the company?" said
she, cheerfully, when she had got within and sat down.</p>

<p>Her grandmother had ostensibly taken to her knitting;
but she managed all the same to keep a sharp eye on the
young man; for she was curious, and wanted to know
something further of the parcel that he had left with her.
It was not merely hospitality or a freak of courtesy that
had caused her to give him this sudden invitation. Her
granddaughter Judith was a self-willed wench and mischievous;
she would keep an eye on her too; she would
learn more of this commerce between her and the young
gentleman who had apparently dropped, as it were, from
the skies. As for little Willie Hart, he remained outside,
regarding the stranger with no great good-will; but perhaps
more with wonder than with anger, for he marvelled
to hear Judith talk familiarly with this person, of whom
he had never heard a word, as though she had known him
for years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>"'Tis not for one such as I," said Master Leofric Hope,
modestly&mdash;and with such a friendly regard toward Judith
that she turned away her eyes and kept looking at this
and that in the garden&mdash;"to speak of the beauties of the
work; I can but tell you of the delight I have myself experienced.
And yet how can I even do that? How can
I make you understand that&mdash;or my gratitude either,
sweet Mistress Judith&mdash;unless you know something of the
solitude of the life I am compelled to lead? You would
have yourself to live at Bassfield Farm; and watch the
monotony of the days there; and be scarcely able to pass
the time: then would you know the delight of being introduced
to this fair region that your father hath invented,
and being permitted to hear those creatures of his
imagination speak to each other. Nay, but 'tis beautiful!
I am no critical judge; but I swear 'twill charm the
town."</p>

<p>"You think so, sir?" said she, eagerly, and for an instant
she withdrew her eyes from the contemplation of
the flowers. But immediately she altered her tone to one
of calm indifference. "My father hath many affairs to
engage him, you must understand, good sir; perchance,
now, this play is not such as he would have written had
he leisure, and&mdash;and had he been commanded by the
court, and the like. Perchance 'tis too much of the human
kind for such purposes?"</p>

<p>"I catch not your meaning, sweet lady," said he.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said she, calmly, "of the masques
you told us of&mdash;at Theobald's and elsewhere&mdash;that Master
Benjamin Jonson has written, and that they all seem to
prize so highly: perchance these were of a finer stuff than
my father hath time to think of, being occupied, as it
were, with so many cares. 'Tis a rude life, having regard
to horses, and lands, and malt, and the rest; and&mdash;and
the court ladies&mdash;they would rather have the gods and
goddesses marching in procession, would they not? My
father's writing is too much of the common kind, is it not,
good sir?&mdash;'tis more for the 'prentices, one might say, and
such as these?"</p>

<p>He glanced at her. He was not sure of her.</p>

<p>"The King, sweet lady," said he, "is himself learned,
and would have the court familiar with the ancient
tongues; and for such pageants 'tis no wonder they employ
Master Jonson, that is a great scholar. But surely
you place not such things&mdash;that are but as toys&mdash;by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>side of your father's plays, that all marvel at, and applaud,
and that have driven away all others from our stage?"</p>

<p>"Say you so?" she answered, with the same indifferent
demeanor. "Nay, I thought that Master Scoloker&mdash;was
that his worship's name?&mdash;deemed them to be of the vulgar
sort. But perchance he was one of the learned ones.
The King, they say, is often minded to speak in the Latin.
What means he by that, good sir, think you? Hath he
not yet had time to learn our English speech?"</p>

<p>"Wench, what would you?" her grandmother interposed,
sharply. "Nay, good sir, heed her not; her
tongue be an unruly member, and maketh sport of her,
as I think; but the wench meaneth no harm."</p>

<p>"The King is proud of his learning, no doubt," said he;
and he would probably have gone on to deprecate any
comparison between the court masques and her father's
plays but that she saw here her opportunity, and interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"I know it," she said, "for the letter that the King sent
to my father is writ in the Latin."</p>

<p>"Nay, is it so?" said he.</p>

<p>She affected not to observe his surprise.</p>

<p>"'Twas all the same to my father," she continued, calmly,
"whether the letter was in one tongue or the other.
He hath one book now&mdash;how is it called?&mdash;'tis a marvellous
heap of old stories&mdash;the Jests&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>?" he said.</p>

<p>"The same, as I think. Well, he hath one copy that is
in English, and of our own time, as I am told; but he
hath also another and a very ancient copy, that is in the
Latin tongue; and this it is&mdash;the Latin one, good sir&mdash;that
my father is fondest of; and many a piece of merriment
he will get out of it, when Julius Shawe is in the
house of an evening."</p>

<p>"But the <i>Gesta</i> are not jests, good Mistress Judith,"
said he, looking somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>"I know not; I but hear them laughing," said she,
placidly. "And as for the book itself, all I know of it is
the outside; but that is right strange and ancient, and
beautiful withal: the back of it white leather stamped with
curious devices; and the sides of parchment printed in
letters of red and <span class="err" title="original: biack">black</span>; and the silver clasps of it with each
a boar's head. I have heard say that that is the crest of
the Scotch knight that gave the volume to my father when
they were all at Aberdeen; 'twas when they made Laurence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>Fletcher a burgess; and the knight said to my father,
'Good sir, the honor to your comrade is a general one,
but I would have you take this book in particular, in the
way of thanks and remembrance for your wit and pleasant
company'&mdash;that, or something like that, said he; and my
father is right proud of the book, that is very ancient and
precious; and often he will read out of it&mdash;though it be
in the Latin tongue. Oh, I assure you, sir," she added,
with a calm and proud air, "'tis quite the same thing to
him. If the King choose to write to him in that tongue,
well and good. Marry, now I think of it, I make no
doubt that Julius Shawe would lend me the letter, did
you care to see it."</p>

<p>He looked up quickly and eagerly.</p>

<p>"Goes your goodness so far, sweet Mistress Judith?
Would you do me such a favor and honor?"</p>

<p>"Nay, young sir," the grandmother said, looking up
from her knitting, "tempt not the wench; she be too
ready to do mad things out of her own mind. And you,
grandchild, see you meddle not in your father's affairs."</p>

<p>"Why, grandam," Judith cried, "'tis the common property
of Stratford town. Any one that goeth into Julius
Shawe's house may see it. And why Julius Shawe's
friends only? Beshrew me, there are others who have as
good a title to that letter&mdash;little as my father valueth it."</p>

<p>"Nay, I will forego the favor," said he at once, "though
I owe you none the less thanks, dear lady, for the intention
of your kindness. In truth, I know not how to make you
sensible of what I already owe you; for, having made acquaintance
with those fair creations, how can one but long
to hear of what further befell them? My prayer would
rather go in that direction&mdash;if I might make so bold."</p>

<p>He regarded her now with a timid look. Well, she had
not undertaken that he should see the whole of the play,
nor had she ever hinted to him of any such possibility;
but it had been in her mind, and for the life of her she
could not see any harm in this brief loan of it. Harm?
Had not even this brief portion of it caused him to think
of her father's creations as if they were of a far more marvellous
nature than the trumpery court performances that
had engrossed his talk when first she met him?</p>

<p>"There might be some difficulty, good sir," said she,
"but methinks I could obtain for you the further portions,
if my good grandmother here would receive them and hand
them to you when occasion served."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>"What's that, wench?" her grandmother said, instantly.</p>

<p>"'Tis but a book, good grandam, that I would lend Master
Hope to lighten the dulness of his life at the farm
withal: you cannot have any objection, grandmother?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a new trade to find thee in, wench," said her grandmother.
"I'd 'a thought thou wert more like to have secret
commerce in laces and silks."</p>

<p>"I am no pedler, good madam," said he, with a smile;
"else could I find no pleasanter way of passing the time
than in showing to you and your fair granddaughter my
store of braveries. Nay, this that I would beg of you is
but to keep the book until I have the chance to call for it;
and that is a kindness you have already shown in taking
charge of the little package I left for Mistress Judith here."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well," said the old dame, "if 'tis anything
belonging to her father, see you bring it back, and let not
the wench get into trouble."</p>

<p>"I think you may trust me so far, good madam," said
he, with such simplicity of courtesy and sincerity that even
the old grandmother was satisfied.</p>

<p>In truth she had been regarding the two of them with
some sharpness during these few minutes to see if she
could detect anything in their manner that might awaken
suspicion. There was nothing. No doubt the young
gentleman regarded Judith with an undisguised wish to be
friendly with her, and say pretty things; but was that to
be wondered at? 'Twas not all the lads in Stratford that
would be so modest in showing their admiration for a winsome
lass. And this book-lending commerce was but natural
in the circumstances. She would have been well
content to hear that his affairs permitted him to leave the
neighborhood, and that would happen in good time;
meanwhile there could be no great harm in being civil to
so well-behaved a young gentleman. So now, as she had
satisfied herself that the leaving of the package meant
nothing dark or dangerous, she rose and hobbled away in
search of the little maid, to see that some ale were brought
out for the refreshment of her visitor.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart Willie," Judith called, "what have you
there? Come hither!"</p>

<p>Her small cousin had got hold of the cat, and was vainly
endeavoring to teach it to jump over his clasped hands.
He took it up in his arms, and brought it with him to the
arbor, though he did not look in the direction of the
strange gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>"We shall be setting forth for home directly," said she.
"Wilt thou not sit down and rest thee?"</p>

<p>"'Tis no such distance, cousin," said he.</p>

<p>He seemed unwilling to come in; he kept stroking the
cat, with his head averted. So she went out to him, and
put her arm round his neck.</p>

<p>"This, sir," said she, "is my most constant companion,
next to Prudence Shawe; I know not to what part of all
this neighborhood we have not wandered together. And
such eyes he hath for the birds' nests; when I can see
naught but a cloud of leaves he will say, why, 'tis so and
so, or so and so; and up the tree like a squirrel, and down
again with one of the eggs, or perchance a small naked
birdling, to show me. But we always put them back,
sweetheart, do we not?&mdash;we leave no bereft families, or
sorrowing mother bird to find an empty nest. We do as
we would be done by; and 'tis no harm to them that we
should look at the pretty blue eggs, or take out one of the
small chicks with its downy feathers and its gaping bill.
And for the fishing, too&mdash;there be none cleverer at setting
a line, as I hear, or more patient in watching; but I like
not that pastime, good Cousin Willie, for or soon or late
you are certain to fall through the bushes into the river,
as happened to Dickie Page last week, and there may not
be some one there to haul you out, as they hauled out him."</p>

<p>"And how fares he at the school?" said the young gentleman
in the arbor.</p>

<p>"Oh, excellent well, as I am told," said she, "although
I be no judge of lessons myself. Marry, I hear good news
of his behavior; and if there be a bloody nose now and
again, why, a boy that's attacked must hold his own, and
give as good as he gets&mdash;'twere a marvel else&mdash;and 'tis no
use making furious over it, for who knows how the quarrel
began? Nay, I will give my cousin a character for being
as gentle as any, and as reasonable; and if he fought with
Master Crutchley's boy, and hit him full sore, I fear, between
the eyes&mdash;well, having heard something of the matter,
I make no doubt it served young Crutchley right, and
that elder people should have a care in condemning when
they cannot know the beginning of the quarrel. Well,
now I bethink me, sweetheart, tell me how it began, for
that I never heard. How began the quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Nay, 'twas nothing," he said, shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"Nothing? Nay, that I will not believe. I should not
wonder now if it were about some little wench. What?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>Nay, I'll swear it now! 'Twas about the little wench that
has come to live at the Vicarage&mdash;what's her name?&mdash;Minnie,
or Winnie?"</p>

<p>"'Twas not, then, Judith," said he. "If you must know,
I will tell you; I had liefer say naught about it. But
'twas not the first time he had said so&mdash;before all of them&mdash;that
my uncle was no better than an idle player, that
ought to be put in the stocks and whipped."</p>

<p>"Why, now," said she, "to think that the poor lad's
nose should be set a-bleeding for nothing more than that!"</p>

<p>"It had been said more than once, Cousin Judith; 'twas
time it should end," said he, simply.</p>

<p>At this moment Master Leofric Hope called to him.</p>

<p>"Come hither, my lad," said he. "I would hear how
you get on at school."</p>

<p>The small lad turned and regarded him, but did not
budge. His demeanor was entirely changed. With Judith
he was invariably gentle, submissive, abashed: now, as he
looked at the stranger, he seemed to resent the summons.</p>

<p>"Come hither, my lad."</p>

<p>"Thank you, no, sir," he said; "I would as lief be
here."</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, be these your manners?" Judith said.</p>

<p>But the young gentleman only laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Didst thou find any such speeches in the <i>Sententi
Pueriles</i>?" said he. "They were not there when I was at
school."</p>

<p>"When go we back to Stratford, Judith?" said the boy.</p>

<p>"Presently, presently," said she (with some vague impression
that she could not well leave until her grandmother's
guest showed signs of going also). "See, here is
my grandam coming with various things for us; and I
warrant me you shall find some gingerbread amongst
them."</p>

<p>The old dame and the little maid now came along, bringing
with them ale and jugs and spiced bread and what not,
which were forthwith put on the small table; and though
Judith did not care to partake of these, and was rather
wishful to set out homeward again, still, in common courtesy,
she was compelled to enter the arbor and sit down.
Moreover, Master Hope seemed in no hurry to go. It was
a pleasant evening, the heat of the day being over; the
skies were clear, fair, and lambent with the declining golden
light: why should one hasten away from this quiet
bower, in the sweet serenity and silence, with the perfume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>of roses all around, and scarce a breath of air to stir the
leaves? He but played with this slight refection; nevertheless,
it was a kind of excuse for the starting of fresh
talk; and his talk was interesting and animated. Then he
had discovered a sure and easy way of pleasing Judith,
and instantly gaining her attention. When he spoke of
the doings in London, her father was no longer left out
of these: nay, on the contrary, he became a central figure;
and she learned more now of the Globe and Blackfriars
theatres than ever she had heard in her life before. Nor
did she fail to lead him on with questions. Which of her
father's friends were most constant attendants at the theatre?
Doubtless they had chairs set for them on the stage?
Was there any one that her father singled out for especial
favor? When they went to the tavern in the evening,
what place had her father at the board? Did any of the
young lords go with them? How late sat they? Did her
father outshine them all with his wit and merriment, or
did he sit quiet and amused?&mdash;for sometimes it was the
one and sometimes the other with him here in Stratford.
Did they in London know that he had such a goodly house,
and rich lands, and horses? And was there good cooking
at the tavern&mdash;Portugal dishes and the like? Or perchance
(she asked, with an inquiring look from the beautiful,
clear eyes) it was rather poor? And the napery, now: it
was not always of the cleanest? And instead of neat-handed
maids, rude serving-men, tapsters, drawers, and so
forth? And the ale&mdash;she could be sworn 'twas no better
than the Warwickshire ale; no, nor was the claret likely
to be better than that brought into the country for the
gentlefolk by such noted vintners as Quiney. Her father's
lodging&mdash;that he said was well enough, as he said everything
was well enough, for she had never known him utter
a word of discontent with anything that happened to him&mdash;perchance
'twas none of the cleanliest? for she had
heard that the London housewives were mostly slovens,
and would close you doors and windows against the air,
so that a countryman going to that town was like to be
sickened. And her father&mdash;did he ever speak of his family
when he was in London? Did they know he had belongings?
Nay, she was certain he must have talked to his
friends and familiars of little Bess Hall, for how could he
help that?</p>

<p>"You forget, sweet Mistress Judith," said he, in his
pleasant way, "that I have not the honor of your father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>friendship, nor of his acquaintance even, and what I have
told you is all of hearsay, save with regard to the theatre,
where I have seen him often. And that is the general
consent: that this one may have more learning, and that
one more sharpness of retort, but that in these encounters
he hath a grace and a brilliancy far outvying them all, and,
moreover, with such a gentleness as earns him the general
good-will. Such is the report of him; I would it had been
in my power to speak from my own experience."</p>

<p>"But that time will come, good sir," said she, "and soon,
I trust."</p>

<p>"In the mean while," said he, "bethink you what a
favor it is that I should be permitted to come into communion
with those fair creations of his fancy; and I would
remind you once more of your promise, sweet Mistress
Judith; and would beseech your good grandmother to take
charge of anything you may leave for me. Nay, 'twill be
for no longer than an hour or two that I would detain it;
but that brief time I would have free from distractions, so
that the mind may dwell on the picture. Do I make too
bold, sweet lady? Or does your friendship go so far?"</p>

<p>"In truth, sir," she answered, readily, "if I can I will
bring you the rest of the play&mdash;but perchance in portions,
as the occasion serves; 'twere no great harm should you
carry away with you some memory of the Duke and his
fair daughter on the island."</p>

<p>"The time will pass slowly until I hear more of them,"
said he.</p>

<p>"And meanwhile, good grandmother," said she, "if you
will tell me where I may find the little package, methinks
I must be going."</p>

<p>At this he rose.</p>

<p>"I beseech your pardon if I have detained you, sweet
lady," said he, with much courtesy.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, I am indebted to you for welcome news," she
answered, "and I would I had longer opportunity of hearing.
And what said you&mdash;that he outshone them all?&mdash;that
it was the general consent?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it?" he said, gallantly.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, we of his own household&mdash;and his friends in
Stratford&mdash;we know and see what my father is: so well
esteemed, in truth, as Julius Shawe saith, that there is not
a man in Warwickshire would cheat him in the selling of
a horse, which they are not slow to do, as I hear, with
others. But I knew not he had won so wide and general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>a report in London, where they might know him not so
well as we."</p>

<p>"Let me assure you of that, dear lady," he said, "and
also that I will not forget to bring or send you the printed
tribute to his good qualities that I spoke of, when that I
may with safety go to London. 'Tis but a trifle; but it
may interest his family; marry, I wonder he hath not himself
spoken of it to you."</p>

<p>"He speak of it!" said she, regarding him with some
surprise, as if he ought to have known better. "We scarce
know aught of what happeneth to him in London. When
he comes home to Warwickshire it would seem as if he had
forgotten London and all its affairs, and left them behind
for good."</p>

<p>"Left them behind for good, say you, wench?" the
old dame grumbled, mostly to herself, as she preceded
them down the path. "I would your father had so much
sense. What hath he to gain more among the players and
dicers and tavern brawlers and that idle crew? Let him
bide at home, among respectable folk. Hath he not enough
of gear gathered round him, eh? It be high time he slipped
loose from those mummers that play to please the cut-purses
and their trulls in London. Hath he not enough
of gear?"</p>

<p>"What say you, grandmother? You would have my
father come away from London and live always in Warwickshire?
Well, now, that is nearer than you think, or
my guesses are wrong."</p>

<p>But her grandmother had gone into the cottage; and
presently she returned with the little package. Then
there was a general leave-taking at the gate; and Leofric
Hope, after many expressions of his thanks and good-will,
set out on his own way, Judith and her cousin taking the
path through the meadows.</p>

<p>For some time they walked in silence; then, as soon as
the stranger was out of ear-shot, the lad looked up and
said,</p>

<p>"Who is that, Judith?"</p>

<p>"Why," said she, lightly, "I scarcely know myself; but
that he is in misfortune and hiding, and that he knoweth
certain of my father's friends, and that he seems pleased
to have a few words with one or other of us to cheer his
solitude. You would not begrudge so much, sweetheart?
Nay, there is more than that I would have you do: his
safety depends on there being no talk about him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>town; and I know you can keep a secret, Cousin Willie;
so you must not say a word to any one&mdash;whether at school,
or at home, or at New Place&mdash;of your having seen him.
You will do as much for my sake, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but why for your sake, cousin?" said the boy,
looking up. "Why should you concern yourself?"</p>

<p>"Nay, call it for anybody's sake, then," said she. "But
I would not have him betrayed by any one that I had
aught to do with&mdash;and least of all by you, sweetheart, that
I expect to show nothing but fair and manly parts. Nay,
I trust you. You will not blab."</p>

<p>And then, as they walked on, it occurred to her that
this young gentleman's secret&mdash;if he wished it kept&mdash;was
becoming somewhat widely extended in his neighborhood.
In her own small circle how many already knew of his
presence?&mdash;her grandmother, Prudence Shawe, herself,
Tom Quiney, and now this little Willie Hart. And she
could not but remember that not much more than half an
hour ago she had seen him at the garden gate, carelessly
chatting, and apparently not heeding in the least what
passers-by might observe him. But that was always the
way: when she left him, when she was with her own
thoughts, curious surmises would cross her mind; whereas,
when she met him, these were at once discarded. And
so she took to arguing with herself as to why she should
be so given to do this young man injustice in his absence,
when every time she encountered him face to face she
was more than ever convinced of his honesty. Fascination?
Well, she liked to hear of London town and the
goings on there; and this evening she had been particularly
interested in hearing about the Globe Theatre, and the
spectators, and the tavern to which her father and his
friends repaired for their supper; but surely that would
not blind her if she had any reason to think that the young
man was other than he represented? And then, again,
this evening he had been markedly deferential. There
was nothing in his manner of that somewhat too open
gallantry he had displayed in the morning when he made
his speech about the English roses. Had she not wronged
him, then, in imagining even for a moment that he had
played a trick upon her in order to make her acquaintance?
It is true, she had forgotten to make special remark of his
eyes, as to whether they were like those of the wizard; for
indeed the suspicion had gone clean out of her mind. But
now she tried to recall them; and she could not fairly say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>to herself that there was a resemblance. Nay, the wizard
was a solemn person, who seemed to rebuke her light-heartedness;
he spoke gravely and slow; whereas this
young man, as any one could see, had a touch of merriment
in his eye that was ready to declare itself on further
acquaintance, only that his deference kept him subdued,
while his talk was light and animated and rapid. No, she
would absolve him from this suspicion; and soon, indeed,
as she guessed, he would absolve himself by removing
from the neighborhood, and probably she would hear no
more of him, unless, perchance, he should remember to
send her that piece of print concerning her father.</p>

<p>And then her thoughts went far afield. She had heard
much of London that evening; and London, in her mind,
was chiefly associated with her father's plays, or such as
she knew of them; and these again were represented to
her by a succession of figures, whose words she thought
of, whose faces she saw, when, as now, her fancies were
distant. And she was more silent than usual as they went
on their way across the meadows, and scarce addressed a
word to her companion; insomuch that at last he looked
up into her face, and said,</p>

<p>"Judith, why are you so sad this evening?"</p>

<p>"Sad, sweetheart? Surely no," she answered; and she
put her hand on his head. "What makes thee think so?"</p>

<p>"Did Dame Hathaway speak harshly to you?" said he.
"Methought I heard her say something. Another time I
will bid her hold her peace."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, not so," said she; and as they were now
come to a stile, she paused there, and drew the boy toward
her.</p>

<p>Not that she was tired; but the evening was so quiet
and still, and the whole world seemed falling into a gentle
repose. There was not a sound near them; the earth was
hushed as it, sank to sleep; far away they could hear the
voices of children going home with their parents, or the
distant barking of a dog. It was late, and yet the skies
seemed full of light, and all the objects around them were
strangely distinct and vivid. Behind them, the northwestern
heavens were of a pale luminous gold; overhead and
in front of them, the great vault was of a beautiful lilac-gray,
deepening to blue in the sombre east; and into this
lambent twilight the great black elms rose in heavy masses.
The wide meadows still caught some of the dying radiance;
and there was a touch of it on the westward-looking gables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>of one or two cottages; and then through this softened
glow there came a small keen ray of lemon yellow&mdash;a light
in one of the far-off windows that burned there like a star.
So hushed this night was, and so calm and beautiful, that
a kind of wistfulness fell over her mind&mdash;scarcely sadness,
as the boy had imagined&mdash;but a dull longing for sympathy,
and some vague wonder as to what her life might be in the
years to come.</p>

<p>"Why, sweetheart," said she, absently, and her hand lay
affectionately on his shoulder, "as we came along here this
evening we were speaking of all that was to happen to you
in after-life; and do you never think you would like to
have the picture unrolled now, and see for yourself, and
have assurance? Does not the mystery make you impatient,
or restless, or sad&mdash;so that you would fain have the
years go by quick, and get to the end? Nay, I trow not;
the day and the hour are sufficient for thee; and 'tis better
so. Keep as thou art, sweetheart, and pay no heed to what
may hereafter happen to thee."</p>

<p>"What is't that troubles you, Judith?" said he, with an
instinctive sympathy, for there was more in her voice than
in her words.</p>

<p>"Why, I know not myself," said she, slowly, and with
her eyes fixed vacantly on the darkening landscape.
"Nothing, as I reckon. 'Tis but beating one's wings
against the invisible to seek to know even to-morrow. And
in the further years some will have gone away from Stratford,
and some to far countries, and some will be married,
and some grown old; but to all the end will be the same;
and I dare say now that, hundreds of years hence, other
people will be coming to Stratford, and they will go into
the church-yard there, and walk about and look at the
names&mdash;that is, of you and me and all the rest of us&mdash;and
they will say, 'Poor things, they vexed themselves about
very small matters while they were alive, but they are all
at peace at last.'"</p>

<p>"But what is it that troubles you, Judith?" said he; for
this was an unusual mood with her, who generally was so
thoughtless and merry and high-hearted.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, sweetheart, nothing," said she, seeming
to rouse herself. "'Tis the quiet of the night that is so
strange, and the darkness coming. Or will there be moonlight?
In truth, there must be, and getting near to the
full, as I reckon. A night for Jessica! Heard you ever
of her sweetheart?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>"No, Judith."</p>

<p>"Well, she was a fair maiden that lived long ago, somewhere
in Italy, as I think. And she ran away with her
lover, and was married to him, and was very happy; and
all that is now known of her is connected with music and
moonlight and an evening such as this. Is not that a fair
life to lead after death: to be in all men's thoughts always
as a happy bride, on such a still night as this is now? And
would you know how her lover spoke to her?&mdash;this is what
he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creep to our ears; soft stillness and the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit, Jessica: Look, how the floor of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in his motion like an angel sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw her home with music.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Is not that a gentle speech? And so shall you speak to
your bride, sweetheart, in the years to come, when you
have wooed her and won her. And then you will tell her
that if she loves you not&mdash;ay, and if she loves you not dearly
and well&mdash;then is she not like one that you knew long
ago, and that was your cousin, and her name was Judith
Shakespeare. Come, sweetheart," said she, and she rose
from the stile and took his hand in hers. "Shall I draw
thee home? But not with sweet music, for I have not
Susan's voice. I would I had, for thy sake."</p>

<p>"You have the prettiest voice in the whole world, Cousin
Judith," said he.</p>

<p>And so they walked on and into the town, in silence
mostly. The world had grown more solemn now: here
and there in the lilac-gray deeps overhead a small silver
point began to appear. And sure he was that whatever
might happen to him in the years to come, no sweetheart
or any other would ever crush out from his affection or
from his memory this sweet cousin of his; for him she
would always be the one woman, strange and mystical and
kind; there never would be any touch like the touch of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>her hand, so gentle was it as it rested on his hair; and
there never would be anything more wonderful and gracious
to look forward to than the old and familiar sitting
in the church pew by Judith's side, with the breathless fascination
of knowing that she was so near, and the thrill
of hearing her join (rather timidly, for she was not proud of
her voice) in the singing of the choir.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>A DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p>"That be so as I tell ye, zur," said Matthew gardener,
as he <span class="err" title="original: slowy">slowly</span> sharpened a long knife on the hone that he
held in his hand; "it all cometh of the pampering of
queasy stomachs nowadays that cannot hold honest food.
There be no such folk now as there wur in former days,
when men wur hardy, and long-lived, and healthy; and
why, zur?&mdash;why, but that they wur content wi' plain dishes
of pulse or herbs, and for the most worshipful no more
than a dish of broth and a piece of good wholesome beef
withal. But nowadays, Lord! Lord!&mdash;dish after dish,
with each his several sauce; and this from Portugal and
that from France, so that gluttony shall have its swing, and
never a penny be kept for the poor. Nay, I tell ye, zur,
rich and poor alike wur stronger and healthier when there
wur no such waste in the land; when a man would wear
his frieze coat and hosen of the color of the sheep that bore
them; and have his shirt of honest hemp or flax, and could
sleep well with his head on a block of wood and a sheep-skin
thrown o'er it. But nowadays must he have his shirt
of fine lawn and needle-work; ay, and his soft pillow to
lie on, so that his lily-white body shall come to no scratching;
nor will he drink any longer small drink, no, nor
water, but heavy ales and rich wines; and all goeth to the
belly, and naught to his poorer neighbor. And what cometh
of this but tender stomachs, and riot, and waste?&mdash;and
lucky if Bocardo be not at the end of it all."</p>

<p>As it chanced on this fine morning, Judith's father had
strolled along to look at some trained apple-trees at the
further end of the garden, and finding goodman Matthew
there, and having a mind for idleness, had sat down on a
bench to hear what news of the condition of the land
Matthew might have to lay before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>"Nay, but, good Matthew," said he, "if these luxuries
work such mischief, 'tis the better surely that the poor
have none of them. They, at least, cannot have their
stomachs ruined with sauces and condiments."</p>

<p>"Lord bless ye, zur," said the ancient, with a wise smile,
"'tis not in one way, but in all ways, that the mischief is
done; for the poorest, seeing such waste and gluttony
everywhere abroad, have no continence of their means, but
will spend their last penny on any foolishness. Lord!
Lord! they be such poor simple creatures! they that have
scarce a rag to their backs will crowd at the mops and
fairs, and spend their money&mdash;on what? Why, you must
ha' witnessed it, zur&mdash;the poor fools!&mdash;emptying their
pouches to see a woman walking on a rope, or a tumbler
joining his hands to his heels, or a hen with two heads.
The poor simple creatures!&mdash;and yet I warrant me they be
none so poor but that the rascal doctor can make his money
out o' them: 'tis a foine way o' making a fortune that, going
vagrom about the country with his draughts and pills&mdash;not
honest medicines that a body might make out o' wholesome
herbs, but nauseous stinking stuff that robs a man of
his breath in the very swallowing of it. And the almanac-makers,
too&mdash;marry, that, now, is another thriving trade!&mdash;the
searching of stars, and the prophesying of dry or wet
weather! Weather? what know they of the weather, the
town-bred rogues, that lie and cheat to get at the poor
country folks' money? God 'a mercy, a whip to their
shoulders would teach them more o' the weather than ever
they are like to get out of the stars! And yet the poor
fools o' countrymen&mdash;that scarce know a B from a battle-door&mdash;will
sit o' nights puzzling their brains o'er the signs
o' the heavens; and no matter what any man with eyes
can see for himself&mdash;ay, and fifty times surer, as I take it&mdash;they
will prophesy you a dry month or a wet month, because
the almanac saith so; and they will swear to you
that Taurus&mdash;that is a lion&mdash;and the virgin scales have
come together, therefore there must be a blight on the
pear-trees! Heard you ever the like, zur?&mdash;that a man in
Lunnon, knowing as much about husbandry and farm-work
as a cat knows about quoit-throwing, is to tell me the
weather down here in Warwickshire? God help us, they
be poor weak creatures that think so; I'd liefer look at the
cover of a penny ballad, if I wanted to know when there
was to be frost o' nights."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p><p>At this juncture the old man grinned, as if some secret
joke were tickling his fancy.</p>

<p>"Why, zur," said he, looking up from the hone, "would
you believe this, zur&mdash;they be such fools that a rogue will
sell them a barren cow for a milch cow if he but put a
strange calf to her. 'Tis done, zur&mdash;'tis done, I assure ye."</p>

<p>"In truth, a scurvy trick!" Judith's father said. He
was idly drawing figures on the ground with a bit of stick
he had got hold of. Perhaps he was not listening attentively;
but at all events he encouraged Matthew to talk.
"But surely with years comes wisdom. The most foolish
are not caught twice with such a trick."</p>

<p>"What of that, zur?" answered Matthew. "There be
plenty of other fools in the land to make the trade of
roguery thrive. 'Tis true that a man may learn by his
own experience; but what if he hath a son that be growing
up a bigger fool than himself? And that's where 'tis
nowadays, zur; there be no waiting and prudence; but
every saucy boy must match on to his maid, and marry her
ere they have a roof to put over their heads. 'Tis a fine
beginning, surely! No waiting, no prudence&mdash;as the rich
are wasteful and careless, so are the poor heedless of the
morrow; and the boy and the wench they must have their
cottage at the lane end, run up of elder poles, and forthwith
begin the begetting of beggars to swarm over the
land. A rare beginning! Body o' me, do they think they
can live on nettles and grass, like Nebuchadnezzar?"</p>

<p>And so the old man continued to rail and grumble and
bemoan, sometimes with a saturnine grin of satisfaction at
his own wit coming over his face; and Judith's father did
not seek to controvert; he listened, and drew figures on
the ground, and merely put in a word now and again. It
was a pleasant morning&mdash;fresh, and clear, and sunny; and
this town of Stratford was a quiet place at that hour, with
the children all at school. Sometimes Judith's father
laughed; but he did not argue; and goodman Matthew,
having it all his own way, was more than ever convinced
not only that he was the one wise man among a generation
of fools, but also that he was the only representative
and upholder of the Spartan virtues that had characterized
his forefathers. It is true that on more than one occasion
he had been found somewhat overcome with ale;
but this, when he had recovered from his temporary confusion,
he declared was entirely due to the rascal brewers
of those degenerate days&mdash;and especially of Warwickshire&mdash;who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>put all manner of abominations into their huff-cap,
so that an honest Worcestershire stomach might easily be
caught napping, and take no shame.</p>

<p>And meanwhile what had been happening in another
part of the garden? As it chanced, Judith had been sent
by her mother to carry to the summer-house a cup of wine
and some thin cakes; and in doing so she of course saw
that both her father and goodman Matthew were at the
further end of the garden, and apparently settled there for
the time being. The opportunity was too good to be lost.
She swiftly went back to the house, secured the portion of
the play that was secreted there, and as quickly coming
out again, exchanged it for an equal number of new sheets.
It was all the work of a couple of minutes; and in another
second she was in her own room, ready to put the precious
prize into her little cupboard of boxes. And yet she
could not forbear turning over the sheets, and examining
them curiously, and she was saying to herself: "You
cruel writing, to have such secrets, and refuse to give
them up! If it were pictures, now, I could make out
something with a guess; but all these little marks, so
much alike, what can one make of them?&mdash;all alike&mdash;with
here and there a curling, as if my father had been amusing
himself&mdash;and all so plain and even, too, with never a blot:
marry, I marvel he should make the other copy, unless
with the intent to alter as he writes. And those words
with the big letters at the beginning&mdash;these be the people's
names&mdash;Ferdinand, and sweet Miranda, and the Duke,
and the ill beast that would harm them all. Why, in
Heaven's mercy, was I so fractious? I might even now
be learning all the story&mdash;here by myself&mdash;the only one in
the land: I might all by myself know the story that will
set the London folk agog in the coming winter. And
what a prize were this, now, for Master Ben Jonson!
Could one but go to him and say, 'Good sir, here be
something better than your masques and mummeries,
your Greeks and clouds and long speeches: put your
name to it, good sir&mdash;nay, my father hath abundant store
of such matter, and we in Warwickshire are no niggards&mdash;put
your name to it, good sir, and you will get the court
ladies to say you have risen a step on the ladder, else have
they but a strange judgment!' What would the goodman
do? Beshrew me, Prudence never told me the name of
the play! But let us call it <i>The Magic Island</i>. <i>The Magic
Island, by Master Benjamin Jonson.</i> What would the wits say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>But here she heard some noise on the stairs; so she
quickly hid away the treasure in the little drawer, and
locked it up safe there until she should have the chance of
asking Prudence to read it to her.</p>

<p>That did not happen until nearly nightfall; for Prudence
had been away all day helping to put the house
straight of a poor woman that was ill and in bed. Moreover,
she had been sewing a good deal at the children's
clothes and her eyes looked tired&mdash;or perhaps it was the
wan light that yet lingered in the sky that gave her that
expression, the candles not yet being lit. Judith regarded
her, and took her hand tenderly, and made her sit down.</p>

<p>"Sweet mouse," said she, "you are wearing yourself
out in the service of others; and if you take such little
heed of yourself, you will yourself fall ill. And now
must I demand of you further labor. Or will it be a
refreshment for you after the fatigues of the day? See, I
have brought them all with me&mdash;the sprite Ariel, and the
sweet prince, and Miranda; but in good sooth I will
gladly wait for another time if you are tired&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, not so, Judith," she answered. "There is nothing
I could like better&mdash;but for one thing."</p>

<p>"What, then?"</p>

<p>"Mean you to show this also to the young gentleman
that is at Bidford?"</p>

<p>"And wherefore not, good Prue? He hath seen so
much of the story, 'twere a pity he should not have the
rest. And what a small kindness&mdash;the loan but for an
hour or two; and I need not even see him, for I have but
to leave it at my grandmother's cottage. And if you heard
what he says of it&mdash;and how grateful he is: marry, it all
lies in this, sweet Prue, that you have not seen him,
else would you be willing enough to do him so small a
favor."</p>

<p>By this time Prudence had lit the candles; and presently
they made their way up-stairs to her own room.</p>

<p>"And surely," said Judith, as her gentle gossip was arranging
the manuscript, "the story will all end well, and
merrily for the sweet maiden, seeing how powerful her
father is? Will he not compel all things to her happiness&mdash;he
that can raise storms, and that has messengers to
fly round the world for him?"</p>

<p>"And yet he spoke but harshly to the young man
when last we saw them," Prudence said. "Why, what's
this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>She had run her eye down the first page; and now she
began reading:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he's composed of harshness. I must remove<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Judith's face had gradually fallen.</p>

<p>"Why, 'tis cruel," said she; "and 'tis cruel of my father
to put such pain on the sweet prince, that is so gentle,
and so unfortunate withal."</p>

<p>But Prudence continued the reading:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>At this point Judith's eyes grew proud and grateful (as
though Miranda had done some brave thing), but she did
not speak.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Nay, is she not fair and modest!" Judith exclaimed&mdash;but
apart; and, as the reading proceeded, she began to
think of how Master Leofric Hope would regard this
maiden. Would he not judge her to be right gentle, and
timid, and yet womanly withal, and frank in her confiding?
And he&mdash;supposing that he were the young prince&mdash;what
would he think of such a one? Was it too submissive
that she should offer to carry the logs? Ought
she to so openly confess that she would fain have him to
be her companion? And then, as Judith was thus considering,
this was what she heard, in Prudence's gentle voice:</p>

<span class="i2"><i>Ferdinand.</i> A thousand thousand!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She clapped her hands and laughed, in delight and
triumph.</p>

<p>"Why, sure her father will relent," she cried.</p>

<p>"But, Judith, Judith, stay," Prudence said, quickly, and
with scarce less gladness. "'Tis so set down; for this is
what her father says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'So glad of this as they I cannot be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who are surprised withal; but by rejoicing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At nothing can be more.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">Nay, I take it he will soon explain to us why he was so
harsh with the young prince&mdash;perchance to try his constancy?"</p>

<p>Well, after that the reading went on as far as the sheets
that Judith had brought; but ever her mind was returning
to the scene between the two lovers, and speculating as to
how Leofric Hope would look upon it. She had no resentment
against Ben Jonson now; her heart was full of
assurance and triumph, and was therefore generous. Her
only vexation was that the night must intervene before
there could be a chance of the young London gentleman
calling at the cottage; and she looked forward to the possibility
of seeing him some time or other with the determination
to be more demure than ever. She would not
expect him to praise this play. Perchance 'twas good
enough for simple Warwickshire folk; but the London
wits might consider it of the vulgar kind? And she
laughed to herself at thinking how awkward his protests
would be if she ventured to hint anything in that direction.</p>

<p>Prudence put the sheets carefully together again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>"Judith, Judith," she said, with a quiet smile, "you
lead me far astray. I ought to find such things wicked
and horrible to the ear; but perchance 'tis because I know
your father, and see him from day to day, that I find them
innocent enough. They seem to rest the mind when one
is sorrowful."</p>

<p>"Beware of them, good Prue; they are the devil himself
come in the guise of an angel to snatch thee away.
Nay, but, sweetheart, why should you be sorrowful?"</p>

<p>"There is Martha Hodgson," said she, simply, "and
her children, nigh to starving; and I cannot ask Julius
for more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Judith's purse was out in an instant.</p>

<p>"Why," said she, "my father did not use half of what I
gave him for the knife he bought at Warwick&mdash;marry, I
guess he paid for it mostly himself; but what there is
here you shall have."</p>

<p>And she emptied the contents on to the table, and pushed
them over to her friend.</p>

<p>"You do not grudge it, Judith?" said Prudence. "Nay,
I will not ask thee that. Nor can I refuse it either, for
the children are in sore want. But why should you not
give it to them yourself, Judith?"</p>

<p>"Why?" said Judith, regarding the gentle face with
kindly eyes. "Shall I tell thee why, sweetheart? 'Tis
but this: that if I were in need, and help to be given me,
I would value it thrice as much if it came from your hand.
There is a way of doing such things, and you have it;
that is all."</p>

<p>"I hear Julius is come in," Prudence said, as she took
up the two candles. "Will you go in and speak with
him?"</p>

<p>There was some strange hesitation in her manner, and
she did not go to the door. She glanced at Judith somewhat
timidly. Then she set the candles down again.</p>

<p>"Judith," said she, "your pity is quick, and you are
generous and kind; I would you could find it in your heart
to extend your kindness."</p>

<p>"How now, good cousin?" Judith said, in amazement.
"What's this?"</p>

<p>Prudence glanced at her again, somewhat uneasily, and
obviously in great embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You will not take it ill, dear Judith?"</p>

<p>"By my life, I will not! Not from you, dear heart,
whatever it be. But what is the dreadful secret?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>"Tom Quiney has spoken to me," she said, diffidently.</p>

<p>Judith eagerly caught both her hands.</p>

<p>"And you! What said you? 'Tis all settled, then!"
she exclaimed, almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"It is as I imagined, Judith," said Prudence, calmly&mdash;and
she withdrew her hands, with a touch of maidenly
pride, perhaps, from what she could not but imagine to be
a kind of felicitation. "He hath no fault to find with the
country. If he goes away to those lands beyond seas, 'tis
merely because you will say no word to hold him back."</p>

<p>"I!" said Judith, impatiently; and then she checked
herself. "But you, sweetheart, what said he to you?"</p>

<p>Prudence's cheeks flushed red.</p>

<p>"He would have me intercede for him," she said, timidly.</p>

<p>"Intercede? with whom?"</p>

<p>"Why, you know, Judith; with whom but yourself?
Nay, but be patient&mdash;have some kindness. The young
man opened his heart to me; and I know he is in trouble.
'Twas last night as we were coming home from the lecture;
and he would have me wait till he left a message at his
door, so that thus we fell behind; and then he told me why it
was that Stratford had grown distasteful to him, and not to
be borne, and why he was going away. How could I help
saying that that would grieve you?&mdash;sure I am you cannot
but be sorry to think of the young man banishing himself
from his own people. And he said that I was your nearest
friend; and would I speak for him? And I answered that
I was all unused to such matters, but that if any pleading
of mine would influence you I would right gladly do him
that service; and so I would, dear Judith; for how can you
bear to think of the youth going away with these godless
men, and perchance never to return to his own land, when
a word from you would restrain him?"</p>

<p>Judith took both her hands again, and looked with a
kindly smile into the timid, pleading eyes.</p>

<p>"And 'tis you, sweet mouse, that come to me with such
a prayer? Was there ever so kind a heart? But that is
you ever and always&mdash;never a thought for yourself, everything
for others. And so he had the cruelty to ask you&mdash;you&mdash;to
bring this message?"</p>

<p>"Judith," said the other, with the color coming into her
face again, "you force me to speak against my will. Nay,
how can I hide from myself, dear friend, that you have plans
and wishes&mdash;perchance suspicions&mdash;with regard to me?
And if what I guess be true&mdash;if that is your meaning&mdash;indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>'tis all built on a wrong foundation: believe me, Judith,
it is so. I would have you assured of it, sweetheart.
You know that I like not speaking of such matters; 'tis
not seemly and becoming to a maiden; and fain would I
have my mind occupied with far other things; but, Judith,
this time I must speak plain; and I would have you put
away from you all such intentions and surmises&mdash;dear
heart, you do me wrong!"</p>

<p>"In good sooth, am I all mistaken?" Judith said, glancing
keenly at her.</p>

<p>"Do you doubt my word, Judith?" said she.</p>

<p>"And yet," her friend said, as if to herself, and musingly,
"there were several occasions: there was the fortune-teller
at Hampton Lucy that coupled you, and Quiney
seemed right merry withal; and then again, when he would
have us play kiss-in-the-ring on the evening after Mary Sadler's
marriage, and I forbade it chiefly for your sake, sweet
mouse, then methought you seemed none overpleased with
my interference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here she happened to look at Prudence, and she could
not fail to see that the whole subject was infinitely distressing
to her. There was a proud, hurt expression on the
gentle face, and a red spot burning in each cheek. So
Judith took hold of her and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Once and forever, dearest heart," said she, "I banish
all such thoughts. And I will make no more plans for
thee, nor suspect thee, but let thee go in thine own way,
in the paths of charity and goodness. But I mean not to
give up thy friendship, sweet Prue; if I cannot walk in
the same path, at least I may stretch a hand over to thee;
and if I but keep so near so true a saint, marry, I shall not
go so far wrong."</p>

<p>She took up one of the candles.</p>

<p>"Shall we go down and see Julius?" said she.</p>

<p>"But Tom Quiney, Judith&mdash;what shall I say?" Prudence
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, say nothing, sweetheart," was the immediate
answer. "'Twas a shame to burden you with such a task.
When he chooses he can at any moment have speech of
me, if his worship be not too proud or too suspicious. In
Stratford we can all of us speak the English tongue, I
hope."</p>

<p>"But, Judith," said the other, slowly and wistfully,
"twenty years is a long space for one to be away from his
native land."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>"Marry is it, sweet mouse," Judith answered, as she
opened the door and proceeded to go down the narrow
wooden steps. "'Tis a long space indeed, and at the end of
it many a thing that seemeth of great import and consequence
now will be no better than an old tale, idle and half
forgotten."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>PORTENTS.</h3>

<p>It was somewhat hard on little Bess Hall that her aunt
Judith was determined she should grow up as fearless as
she herself was, and had, indeed, charged herself with this
branch of her niece's education. The child, it is true, was
not more timid than others of her age, and could face with
fair equanimity beggars, school-boys, cows, geese, and
other dangerous creatures; while as for ghosts, goblins,
and similar nocturnal terrors, Judith had settled all that
side of the question by informing the maids of both families,
in the plainest language, that any one of them found
even mentioning such things to this niece of hers would be
instantaneously and without ceremony shot forth from the
house. But beyond and above all this Judith expected
too much, and would flout and scold when Bess Hall declined
to perform the impossible, and would threaten to go
away and get a small boy out of the school to become her
playmate in future. At this moment, for example, she was
standing at the foot of the staircase in Dr. Hall's house.
She had come round to carry off her niece for the day, and
she had dressed her up like a small queen, and now she
would have her descend the wide and handsome staircase
in noble state and unaided. Bess Hall, who had no ambition
to play the part of a queen, but had, on the other
hand, a wholesome and instinctive fear of breaking her
neck, now stood on the landing, helpless amid all her finery,
and looking down at her aunt in a beseeching sort of
way.</p>

<p>"I shall tumble down, Aunt Judith; I know I shall,"
said she, and budge she would not.</p>

<p>"Tumble down, little stupid! Why, what should make
you tumble down? Are you going forever to be a baby?
Any baby can crawl down-stairs by holding on to the balusters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>"I know I shall tumble down, Aunt Judith&mdash;and then I
shall cry."</p>

<p>But even this threat was of no avail.</p>

<p>"Come along, little goose; 'tis easy enough when you
try it. Do you think I have dressed you up as a grown
woman to see you crawl like a baby? A fine woman&mdash;you!
Come along, I say!"</p>

<p>But this lesson, happily for the half-frightened pupil,
was abruptly brought to an end. Judith was standing with
her face to the staircase, and her back to the central hall
and the outer door, so that she could not see any one entering,
and indeed the first intimation she had of the approach
of a stranger was a voice behind her:</p>

<p>"Be gentle with the child, Judith."</p>

<p>And then she knew that she was caught. For some little
time back she had very cleverly managed to evade the
good parson, or at least to secure the safety of company
when she saw him approach. But this time she was as
helpless as little Bess herself. Dr. Hall was away from
home; Judith's sister was ill of a cold, and in bed; there
was no one in the house, besides the servants, but herself.
The only thing she could do was to go up to the landing,
swing her niece on to her shoulder, and say to Master
Walter that they were going round to New Place, for that
Susan was ill in bed, and unable to look after the child.</p>

<p>"I will walk with you as far," said he, calmly, and, indeed,
as if it were rather an act of condescension on his
part.</p>

<p>She set out with no good-will. She expected that he
would argue, and she had an uncomfortable suspicion that
he would get the best of it. And if she had once or twice
rather wildly thought that in order to get rid of all perplexities,
and in order to please all the people around her,
she would in the end allow Master Walter Blaise to win
her over into becoming his wife, still she felt that the time
was not yet. She would have the choosing of it for herself.
And why should she be driven into a corner prematurely?
Why be made to confess that her brain could
not save her? She wanted peace. She wanted to play
with Bess Hall, or to walk through the meadows with Willie
Hart, teaching him what to think of England. She did
not want to be confronted with clear, cold eyes, and arguments
like steel, and the awful prospect of having to labor
in the vineyard through the long, long, gray, and distant
years. She grew to think it was scarcely fair of her father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>to hand her over. He at least might have been on her
side. But he seemed as willing as any that she should go
away among the saints, and forsake forever (as it seemed
to her) the beautiful, free and clear-colored life that she
had been well content to live.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, it flashed upon her mind
that she was a player's daughter, and a kind of flame went
to her face.</p>

<p>"I pray you, good Master Blaise," said she, with a lofty
and gracious courtesy, "bethink you, ere you give us
your company through the town."</p>

<p>"What mean you, Judith?" said he, in some amazement.</p>

<p>"Do you forget, then, that I am the daughter of a
player?&mdash;and this his granddaughter?" said she.</p>

<p>"In truth, I know not what you mean, Judith," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why," said she, "may not the good people who are
the saints of the earth wonder to see you consort with such
as we?&mdash;or, rather, with one such as I, who am impenitent,
and take no shame that my father is a player&mdash;nay, God's
my witness, I am wicked enough to be proud of it, and I
care not who knows it, and they that hope to have me
change my thoughts on that matter will have no lack of
waiting."</p>

<p>Well, it was a fair challenge; and he answered it frankly,
and with such a reasonableness and charity of speech that,
despite herself, she could not but admit that she was
pleased, and also, perhaps, just a little bit grateful. He
would not set up to be any man's judge, he said; nor was he
a Pharisee; the Master that he served was no respecter of
persons&mdash;He had welcomed all when He was upon the
earth&mdash;and it behooved His followers to beware of pride
and the setting up of distinctions; if there was any house
in the town that earned the respect of all, it was New
Place; he could only speak of her father as he found him,
here, in his own family, among his own friends&mdash;and what
that was all men knew; and so forth. He spoke well,
and modestly; and Judith was so pleased to hear what he
said of her father that she forgot to ask whether all this
was quite consistent with his usual denunciations of plays
and players; his dire prophecy as to the fate of those who
were not of the saints, and his sharp dividing and shutting
off of these. He did not persecute her at all. There was
no argument. What he was mostly anxious about was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>that she should not tire herself with carrying Bess Hall on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Nay, good sir," said she, quite pleasantly, "'tis a trick
my father taught me; and the child is but a feather-weight."</p>

<p>He looked at her&mdash;so handsome and buxom, and full of
life and courage; her eyes lustrous, the rose-leaf tint of
health in her cheeks; and always at the corner of her
mouth what could only be called a disposition to smile, as
if the world suited her fairly well, and that she was ready
at any moment to laugh her thanks.</p>

<p>"There be many, Judith," said he, "who might envy
you your health and good spirits."</p>

<p>"When I lose them, 'twill be time enough to lament
them," said she, complacently.</p>

<p>"The hour that is passing seems all in all to you; and
who can wonder at it?" he continued. "Pray Heaven
your carelessness of the morrow have reason in it! But
all are not so minded. There be strange tidings in the
land."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir; and to what end?" said she.</p>

<p>"I know not whether these rumors have reached your
house," he said, "but never at any time I have read of
have men's minds been so disturbed&mdash;with a restlessness
and apprehension of something being about to happen.
And what marvel! The strange things that have been
seen and heard of throughout the world of late&mdash;meteors,
and earthquakes, and visions of armies fighting in the
heavens. Even so was Armageddon to be foreshadowed.
Nay, I will be honest with you, Judith, and say that it is
not clear to my own mind that the great day of the Lord
is at hand; but many think so; and one man's reading of
the Book of Revelation is but a small matter to set against
so wide a belief. Heard you not of the vision that came
to the young girl at Chipping Camden last Monday?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no, good sir."</p>

<p>"I marvel that Prudence has not heard of it, for all
men are speaking of it. 'Twas in this way, as I hear.
The maiden is one of rare piety and grace, given to fasting,
and nightly vigils, and searching of the heart. 'Twas
on the night of Sunday last&mdash;or perchance toward Monday
morning&mdash;that she was awakened out of her sleep
by finding her room full of light; and looking out of
the window she beheld in the darkness a figure of resplendent
radiance&mdash;shining like the sun, as she said;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>only clear white, and shedding rays around; and the figure
approached the window, and regarded her; and she
dropped on her knees in wonder and fear, and bowed
her head and worshipped. And as she did so, she heard
a voice say to her: 'Watch and pray: Behold, I come
quickly.' And she durst not raise her head, as she
says, being overcome with fear and joy. But the light
slowly faded from the room; and when at last she rose
she saw something afar off in the sky, that was now grown
dark again. And ever since she has been trembling with
the excitement of it, and will take no food; but from
time to time she cries in a loud voice, 'Lord Jesus, come
quickly! Lord Jesus, come quickly!' Many have gone to
see her, as I hear, and from all parts of the country; but
she heeds them not; she is intent with her prayers; and
her eyes, the people say, look as if they had been dazzled
with a great light, and are dazed and strange. Nay, 'tis
but one of many things that are murmured abroad at
present; for there have been signs in the heavens seen in
sundry places, and visions, and men's minds grow anxious."</p>

<p>"And what think you yourself, good sir? You are
one that should know."</p>

<p>"I?" said he. "Nay, I am far too humble a worker to
take upon myself the saying ay or no at such a time; I
can but watch and pray and wait. But is it not strange to
think that we here at this moment, walking along this
street in Stratford, might within some measurable space&mdash;say,
a year, or half a dozen years or so&mdash;that we might be
walking by the pure river of water that John saw flowing
from the throne of God and of the Lamb? Do you not
remember how the early Christians, with such a possibility
before their eyes, drew nearer to each other, as it were,
and rejoiced together, parting with all their possessions,
and living in common, so that the poorest were even as
the rich? 'Twas no terror that overtook them, but a happiness;
and they drew themselves apart from the world,
and lived in their own community, praying with each other,
and aiding each other. 'All that believed,' the Bible
tells us, 'were in one place, and had all things common.
And they sold their possessions and goods, and parted
them to all men, as every one had need. And they continued
daily in the Temple, and, breaking bread at home,
did eat their meat together with gladness and singleness
of heart, praising God, and had favor with all the people;
and the Lord added to the Church from day to day such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>as should be saved.' Such a state of spiritual brotherhood
and exaltation may come among us once more; methinks
I see the symptoms of its approach even now. Blessed
are they who will be in that communion with a pure soul
and a humble mind, for the Lord will be with them as
their guide, though the waters should arise and overflow,
or fire consume the earth."</p>

<p>"Yes, but, good sir," said she, "when the early Christians
you speak of thought the world was near to an end
they were mistaken. And these, now, of our day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whatever is prophesied must come to pass," said he,
"or soon or late, though it is possible for our poor human
judgment to err as to the time. But surely we ought to
be prepared; and what preparation, think you, is sufficient
for so great and awful a change? Joy there may be
in the trivial things of this world&mdash;in the vanities of the
hour, that pass away and are forgotten; but what are
these things to those whose heart is set on the New Jerusalem&mdash;the
shining city? The voice that John heard
proclaimed no lie: 'twas the voice of the Lord of heaven
and earth&mdash;a promise to them that wait and watch for his
coming. 'And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
neither crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for
the first things are passed.... And there shall be
no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb
shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him. And they
shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads.
And there shall be no night there; and they need
no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God
giveth them light, and they shall reign for evermore.'"</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>"'Tis too wonderful a thing for poor sinful creatures to
expect," she said.</p>

<p>But by this time they were at the house, and he could
not say anything further to her; indeed, when he proposed
that she should come into the sitting-room, and that
he would read to her a description of the glories of the
New Jerusalem, out of the Book of Revelation, she excused
herself by saying that she must carry Bess Hall to
see her father. So he went in and sat down, waiting for
Judith's mother to be sent for; while aunt and niece
went out and through the back yard to the garden.</p>

<p>"Bess," said Judith, on the way, "heardst thou aught
of a white figure?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>"No, Judith," said the child, who had been engaged all
the way in examining the prettinesses of her aunt's velvet
cap, and ruff, and what not.</p>

<p>"That is well," said she.</p>

<p>When she got into the garden, she could see that good
man Matthew eyed their approach with little favor&mdash;for
Bess Hall, when her grandfather had charge of her, was
allowed to tear flowers, and walk over beds, or do anything
she chose; but Judith did not mind that much.
On the other hand, she would not go deliberately and disturb
her father. She would give him his choice&mdash;to come
forth or not as he pleased. And so, quite noiselessly, and
at a little distance off, she passed the summer-house. There
was no sign. Accordingly, she went on idly to the further
end of the garden, and would doubtless have remained
there (rather than return within-doors) amusing the child
somehow, but that the next minute her father appeared.</p>

<p>"Come hither, Bess! Come hither, wench!" he called.</p>

<p>Nay, he came to meet them; and as he lifted the child
down from Judith's shoulder, something&mdash;perhaps it was
the touch of the sunlight on the soft brown of her short
curls&mdash;seemed to attract his notice.</p>

<p>"Why, wench," said he to Judith, "methinks your hair
grows prettier every day. And yet you keep it overshort&mdash;yes,
'tis overshort&mdash;would you have them think you a
boy?"</p>

<p>"I would I were a man," said she, glancing at him
rather timidly.</p>

<p>"How, then? What, now?"</p>

<p>"For then," said she, "might I help you in your work,
so please you, sir."</p>

<p>He laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"My work? What know you of that, wench?"</p>

<p>The blood rushed to her face.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, I but meant the work of the fields&mdash;in going
about with the bailiff and the like. The maids say you
were abroad at five this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, is't not the pleasantest time of the day in this
hot weather?" he said&mdash;and he seemed amused by her interference.</p>

<p>"But why should you give yourself so many cares, good
father?" she made bold to say (for she had been meditating
the saying of it for many a day back). "You that
have great fame, and land, and wealth. We would fain
see you rest a little more, father; and 'tis all the harder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>to us that we can give you no help, being but women-folk."</p>

<p>There was something in the tone of her voice&mdash;or perhaps
in her eyes&mdash;that conveyed more than her words.
He put his hand on her head.</p>

<p>"You are a good lass," said he. "And listen. You can
do something for me that is of far more value to me than
any help in any kind of work: nay, I tell thee 'tis of greater
value to me than all of my work; and 'tis this: keep you
a merry heart, wench&mdash;let me see your face right merry
and cheerful as you go about&mdash;that is what you can do
for me; I would have you ever as you are now, as bright
and glad as a summer day."</p>

<p>"'Tis an easy task, sir, so long as you are content to be
pleased with me," she managed to answer; and then little
Bess Hall&mdash;who could not understand why she should have
been so long left unnoticed&mdash;began to scramble up his
knees, and was at last transferred to his arms.</p>

<p>Judith's heart was beating somewhat quickly&mdash;with a
kind of pride and gladness that was very near bringing
tears to her eyes; but, of course, that was out of the question,
seeing that he had enjoined her to be cheerful. And
so she forced herself to say, with an odd kind of smile,</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir, may I remain with you for a space&mdash;if
Bess and I trouble you not?"</p>

<p>"Surely," said he, regarding her; "but what is it,
then?"</p>

<p>"Why," said she, pulling herself together, "good Master
Blaise is within-doors, and his last belief is enough to
frighten a poor maiden&mdash;let alone this small child. He
says the world is nigh unto its end."</p>

<p>"Nay, I have heard of some such talk being abroad,"
said he, "among the country folk. But why should that
frighten thee? Even were it true, we can make it nor better
nor worse."</p>

<p>"Only this, father," said she, and she looked at him with
the large, clear-shining gray eyes no longer near to tears,
but rather suggesting some dark mystery of humor, "that
if the end of the world be so nigh at hand, 'twould be an
idle thing for the good parson to think of taking him a
wife."</p>

<p>"I ask for no secrets, wench," her father said, as he sat
little Bess Hall on the branch of an apple-tree.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, he but said that as many were of opinion
that something dreadful was about to happen, we should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>all of us draw nearer together. That is well, and to be understanded;
but if the world be about to end for all of us
surely 'twere a strange thing that any of us should think
of taking husband or wife."</p>

<p>"I'll meddle not," her father said. "Go thine own ways.
I have heard thou hast led more than one honest lad in
Stratford a madcap dance. Take heed; take heed&mdash;as thy
grandmother saith&mdash;lest thou outwear their patience."</p>

<p>And then something&mdash;she could scarce tell what&mdash;came
into her head: some wild wish that he would remain always
there at Stratford: would she not right willingly
discard all further thoughts of lovers or sweethearts if
only he would speak to her sometimes as he had just been
speaking; and approve of her hair; and perchance let
her become somewhat more of a companion to him? But
she durst not venture to say so much. She only said, very
modestly and timidly,</p>

<p>"I am content to be as I am, sir, if you are content that
I should bide with you."</p>

<p>"Content?" said he, with a laugh that had no unkindness
in it. "Content that thou shouldst bide with us? Keep
that pretty face of thine merry and glad, good lass&mdash;and
have no fear."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>A LETTER.</h3>

<p>When she should get back from Master Leofric Hope
the last portion of the yet unnamed play, there remained
(as she considered) but one thing more&mdash;to show him the
letter written by the King to her father, so that when the
skies should clear over the young gentleman's head, and
he be permitted to return among his friends and acquaintances,
he might have something else occasionally to talk
of than Ben Jonson and his masques and his favor at
court. Nor had she any difficulty in procuring the letter;
for Prudence was distinctly of opinion that by right it belonged
to Judith, who had coveted it from the beginning.
However, Judith only now wanted the loan of it for a day
or two, until, in her wanderings, she might encounter
Master Hope.</p>

<p>That opportunity soon arrived; for whether it was that
the young gentleman kept a sharp lookout for her, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>whether she was able to make a shrewd guess as to his
probable whereabouts at certain hours of the day, she had
scarcely ever failed to meet him when she went over to
Shottery for the successive instalments of the play that
he had left for her there. On this occasion she had found
the last of these awaiting her at the cottage; and when
she had put it into her velvet satchel, and bade good-by
to her grandmother, she set out for home with a pretty
clear foreknowledge that sooner or later the young gentleman
would appear. Was it not his duty?&mdash;to say what
he thought of all this romance that he had been allowed
to see; and to thank her; and say farewell? For she had
a vague impression that she had done as much as could
reasonably be expected of her in the way of cheering the
solitude of one in misfortune: and she had gathered,
moreover, that he was likely soon to leave the neighborhood.
But she would not have him go without seeing
the King's letter.</p>

<p>Well, when he stepped forth from behind some trees,
she was not surprised; and even the Don had grown accustomed
to these sudden appearances.</p>

<p>"Give ye good-day, sweet lady," said he.</p>

<p>"And to you, sir," she said. "I thank you for your
care in leaving me these pages; I would not have had
any harm come to them, even though my father will in
time throw them away."</p>

<p>"And my thanks to you, sweet Mistress Judith," said
he&mdash;"how can I express them?"&mdash;and therewith he entered
upon such a eulogy of the story he had just been
reading as she was not likely to hear from any Stratford-born
acquaintance. Indeed, he spoke well, and with obvious
sincerity; and although she had intended to receive
these praises with indifference (as though the play were
but a trifle that her father had thrown off easily amid the
pressure of other labors), she did not quite succeed. There
was a kind of triumph in her eyes; her face was glad and
proud; when he quoted a bit of one of Ariel's songs, she
laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"He is a clever musician, that merry imp, is he not?"
said she.</p>

<p>"I would I had such a magic-working spirit to serve
me," said he, looking at her. "One could shape one's
own course then. 'Under the blossom that hangs on the
bough,' would be my motto; there would be no going
back to London or any other town. And what think you:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>might he not find out for me some sweet Miranda?&mdash;not
that I am worthy of such a prize, or could do aught to
deserve her, except in my duty and humble service to her.
The Miranda, I think, could be found," he said, glancing
timidly at her; "nay, I swear I know myself where to
find just such a beautiful and gentle maiden; but where
is the Ariel that would charm her heart and incline her to
pity and kindness?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said she, quickly, "is the letter I said I
would bring you, that the King wrote to my father."</p>

<p>He did not look at the blue velvet satchel; he looked at
her&mdash;perhaps to see whether he had gone too far. But
she did not show any signs of confusion or resentment; at
all events she pretended not to be conscious; and, for one
thing, her eyes were lowered, for the satchel seemed for a
second or so difficult to open. Then she brought forth
the letter.</p>

<p>"Perchance you can tell me the English of it, good
sir?" said she. "'Tis some time since Master Blaise read
it for us, and I would hear it again."</p>

<p>"Nay, I fear my Latin will scarce go so far," said he&mdash;"'tis
but little practice in it I have had since my school-days;
but I will try to make out the sense of it."</p>

<p>She carefully opened the large folded sheet of paper,
and handed it to him. This was what he found before
him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Jacobus D. G.</span> Rex Anglorum et Scotorum poet

<p>He began his translation easily:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'To our trusty and well-beloved poet, William Shakespeare:
Health and greeting.'" But then he began to
stammer. "'When formerly&mdash;when recently&mdash;tarrying in
London&mdash;thy comedy&mdash;thy comedy'&mdash;nay, fair Mistress
Judith, I beseech your pardon; I am grown more rusty
than I thought, and would not destroy your patience. Perchance,
now, you would extend your favor once more,
and let me have the letter home with me, so that I might
spell it out in school-boy fashion?"</p></div>

<p>She hesitated; but only for a second.</p>

<p>"Nay, good sir, I dare not. These sheets of the play
were thrown aside, and so far of little account; but this&mdash;if
aught were to come amiss to this letter, how should I
regard myself? If my father value it but slightly, there
be others who think more of it; and&mdash;and they have intrusted
it to me; I would not have it go out of my own
keeping, so please you, and pardon me."</p>

<p>It was clear that she did not like to refuse this favor to
so courteous and grateful a young gentleman. However,
her face instantly brightened.</p>

<p>"But I am in no hurry, good sir," said she. "Why
should you not sit you on the stile there, and take time to
master the letter, while I gather some wild flowers for my
father? In truth, I am in no hurry; and I would fain have
you know what the King wrote."</p>

<p>"I would I were a school-boy again for five minutes,"
said he, with a laugh; but he went obediently to the stile,
and sat down, and proceeded to pore over the contents of
the letter.</p>

<p>And then she wandered off by herself (so as to leave
him quite undisturbed), and began to gather here and
there a wild rose from the hedge, or a piece of meadow-sweet
from the bank beneath, or a bit of yarrow from
among the grass. It was a still, clear, quiet day, with
some rainy clouds in the sky; and beyond these, near to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>the horizon, broad silver shafts of sunlight striking down
on the woods and the distant hills. It looked as if a kind
of mid-day sleep had fallen over the earth; there was
scarce a sound; the birds were silent; and there was not
even enough wind to make a stirring through the wide
fields of wheat or in the elms. The nosegay grew apace,
though she went about her work idly&mdash;kneeling here and
stretching a hand there; and always she kept away from
him, and would not even look in his direction; for she
was determined that he should have ample leisure to
make out the sense of the letter, of which she had but
a vague recollection, only that she knew it was complimentary.</p>

<p>Even when he rose and came toward her she pretended
not to notice. She would show him she was in no hurry.
She was plucking the heads of red clover, and sucking
them to get at the honey; or she was adding a buttercup
or two to her nosegay; or she was carelessly humming to
herself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O stay and hear; your true love's coming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can sing both high and low."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Well, now, Mistress Judith," said he, with an air of
apology, "methinks I have got at the meaning of it, however
imperfectly; and your father might well be proud of
such a commendation from so high a source&mdash;the King, as
every one knows, being a learned man, and skilled in the
arts. And I have not heard that he has written to any
other of the poets of our day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir?" said she, quickly. "Not to Master Jonson?"</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of, sweet lady," said he, "though
he hath sometimes messages to send, as you may suppose,
by one coming from the court. And I marvel not that
your father should put store by this letter that speaks
well of his work&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your pardon, good sir, but 'tis not so," said Judith,
calmly. "Doubtless if the King commend my father's
writing, that showeth that his Majesty is skilled and
learned, as you say; and my father was no doubt pleased
enough&mdash;as who would not be?&mdash;by such a mark of
honor; but as for setting great value on it, I assure you
he did not; nay, he gave it to Julius Shawe. And will
you read it, good sir?&mdash;I remember me there was something
in it about the ancients."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>"'Tis but a rough guess that I can make," said he, regarding
the paper. "But it seems that the King had received
at the hands of one Eugene Collins the book of a
comedy of your father's that had been presented before
his Majesty when he was recently in London. And very
diligently, he says, he has read through the same; and
finds it right subtly conceived, with many beauties and
delights, and such ornaments as are to be approved by an
ingenious mind. It is true his Majesty hints that there may
be parts of the play more calculated than might be to move
the laughter of the vulgar; but you would not have a critic
have nothing but praise?&mdash;and the King's praise is high
indeed. And then he goes on to say that as regards your
father's future work, he would in the most friendly manner
admonish him to study the great masters of the comic
art; that is, Menander the Athenian, and the Romans
Plautus and Terentius, who&mdash;who&mdash;what says the King?&mdash;less
studied to capture the applause of the vulgar than
to lash the vices of the day as with whips. And these he
highly commends as being of great service to the state;
and would have your father be the like: teachers of virtue,
and also props and aids to those whom God hath
placed to rule over the people. He would have your
father be among these public benefactors; and then he adds
that, when occasion serves, he will not fail to extend his
royal favor to your father and his associates; and so commends
him to the protection of God. Nay, 'tis a right
friendly letter; there is none in the land that would not
be proud of it; 'tis not every day nor with every one that
King James would take such trouble and play the part of
tutor."</p>

<p>He handed her the letter, and she proceeded to fold it
up carefully again and put it in her satchel. She said
nothing, but she hoped that these phrases of commendation
would remain fixed in his mind when that he was returned
to London.</p>

<p>And then there was a moment of embarrassment&mdash;or at
least of constraint. He had never been so near the town
with her before (for his praise of her father's comedy, as
they walked together, had taken some time), and there before
them were the orchards and mud walls, and, further
off, the spire of the church among the trees. She did
not like to bid him go, and he seemed loath to say farewell,
he probably having some dim notion that, now he
had seen the end of the play and also this letter, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>might be some difficulty in finding an excuse for another
meeting.</p>

<p>"When do you return to London?" said she, for the sake
of saying something. "Or may you return? I hope, good
sir, your prospects are showing brighter; it must be hard
for one of your years to pass the time in idleness."</p>

<p>"The time that I have spent in these parts," said he,
"has been far more pleasant and joyful to me than I could
have imagined&mdash;you may easily guess why, dear Mistress
Judith. And now, when there is some prospect of my
being able to go, I like it not; so many sweet hours have
been passed here, the very fields and meadows around have
acquired a charm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, but, good sir," said she, a little breathlessly, "at
your time of life you would not waste the days in idleness."</p>

<p>"In truth it has been a gracious idleness!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"At your time of life," she repeated, quickly, "why, to
be shut up in a farm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Prince Ferdinand," said he, "though I would not
compare myself with him, found the time pass pleasantly
and sweetly enough, as I reckon, though he was shut up in
a cave. But then there was the fair Miranda to be his
companion. There is no Ariel to work such a charm for
me, else do you think I could ever bring myself to leave
so enchanting a neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Good sir," said she (in some anxiety to get away), "I
may not ask the reason of your being in hiding, though I
wish you well, and would fain hear there was no further
occasion for it. And I trust there may be none when next
you come to Warwickshire, and that those of our household
who have a better right to speak for it than I, will
have the chance of entertaining you. And now I would
bid you farewell."</p>

<p>"No, dear Judith!" he exclaimed, with a kind of entreaty
in his voice. "Not altogether? Why, look at the
day!&mdash;would you have me say farewell to you on such a
day of gloom and cloud? Surely you will let me take
away a brighter picture of you, and Warwickshire, and our
brief meetings in these quiet spots&mdash;if go I must. In truth
I know not what may happen to me; I would speak plainer;
but I am no free agent; I can but beg of you to judge
me charitably, if ever you hear aught of me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And here he stopped abruptly and paused, considering,
and obviously irresolute and perplexed.</p>

<p>"Why," said he at length, and almost to himself&mdash;"why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>should I go away at all? I will carry logs&mdash;if needs be&mdash;or
anything. Why should I go?"</p>

<p>She knew instantly what he meant; and knew, also, that
it was high time for her to escape from so perilous a situation.</p>

<p>"I pray you pardon me, good sir; but I must go. Come,
Don."</p>

<p>"But one more meeting, sweet Mistress Judith," he
pleaded, "on a fairer day than this&mdash;you will grant as
much?"</p>

<p>"I may not promise," said she; "but indeed I leave with
you my good wishes; and so, farewell!"</p>

<p>"God shield you, dearest lady," said he, bowing low;
"you leave with me also a memory of your kindness that
will remain in my heart."</p>

<p>Well, there was no doubt that she felt very much relieved
when she had left him and was nearing the town; and yet
she had a kind of pity for him too, as she thought of his
going away by himself to that lonely farm: one so gentle,
and so grateful for company, being shut up there on this
gloomy day. Whereas she was going back to a cheerful
house; Prudence was coming round to spend the afternoon
with them, and help to mark the new napery; and
then in the evening the whole of them, her father included,
were going to sup at Dr. Hall's, who had purchased a dishful
of ancient coins in one of his peregrinations, and would
have them come and examine them. Perhaps, after all,
that reference to Miranda was not meant to apply to her.
It was but natural he should speak of Miranda, having just
finished the play. And carrying logs: he could not mean
carrying logs for her father; that would be a foolish jest.
No, no; he would remain at the farm and spend the time
as best he could; and then, when this cloud blew over, he
would return to London, and carry with him (as she hoped)
some discreet rumor of the new work of her father's that
he had praised so highly, and perchance some mention of
the compliments paid by the King; and if, in course of
time, the young gentleman should make his way back to
Stratford again, and come to see them at New Place, and
if his pleasant manner and courtesy proved to be quite irresistible,
so that she had to allow the wizard's prophecy
to come true in spite of herself, why, then, it was the hand
of fate, and none of her doing, and she would have to accept
her destiny with as good a grace as might be.</p>

<p>As she was going into the town she met Tom Quincy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>He was on the other side of the roadway, and after one
swift glance at her, he lowered his eyes, and would have
passed on without speaking. And then it suddenly occurred
to her that she would put her pride in her pocket.
She knew quite well that her maidenly dignity had been
wounded by his suspicions, and that she ought to let him
go his own way if he chose. But, on the other hand (and
this she did not know), there was in her nature an odd
element of what might be called boyish generosity&mdash;of
frankness and common-sense and good comradeship. And
these two had been very stanch comrades in former days,
each being in a curious manner the protector of the other;
for while she many a time came to his aid&mdash;being a trifle
older than he, and always ready with her quick feminine
wit and ingenuity when they were both of them likely to
get into trouble&mdash;he, on his side, was her shield and bold
champion by reason of his superior stature and his strength,
and his terrible courage in face of bulls or barking dogs
and the like. For the moment she only thought of him as
her old companion; and she was a good-natured kind of
creature, and frank and boyish in her ways, and so she
stepped across the road, though there was some mud
about.</p>

<p>"Why can't we be friends?" said she.</p>

<p>"You have enough of other friends," said he.</p>

<p>It was a rebuff; but still&mdash;she would keep down her girlish
pride.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not going away from the country?"
said she.</p>

<p>He did not meet her look; his eyes were fixed on the
ground.</p>

<p>"What is there to keep me in it?" was his answer.</p>

<p>"Why, what is there to keep any of us in it?" she said.
"Heaven's mercy, if we were all to run away when we
found something or another not quite to our liking, what
a fine thing that would be! Nay, I hope there is no truth
in it," she continued, looking at him, and not without some
memories of their escapades together when they were boy
and girl. "'Twould grieve many&mdash;indeed it would. I pray
you think better of it. If for no other, for my sake; we
used to be better friends."</p>

<p>There were two figures now approaching.</p>

<p>"Oh, here come Widow Clemms and her daughter,"
she said; "a rare couple. 'Twill be meat and drink to
them to carry back a story. No matter. Now, fare you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>well; but pray think better of it; there be many that would
grieve if you went away."</p>

<p>He stole a look at her as she passed on: perhaps there
was a trifle more than usual of color in her radiant and sunny
face, because of the approach of the two women. It was
a lingering kind of look that he sent after her; and then
he, too, turned and went on his way&mdash;cursing the parson.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>A VISITOR.</h3>

<p>Master Leofric Hope, on leaving Judith, returned to the
farm, but not to the solitude that had awakened her commiseration.
When he entered his room, which was at the
back of the house, and facing the southern horizon (that
alone showed some streaks of sunlight on this gloomy day),
he found a stranger there&mdash;and a stranger who had evidently
some notion of making himself comfortable, for he
had opened the window, and was now sitting on the sill,
and had just begun to smoke his pipe. His hat, his sword,
and sword-belt he had flung on the table.</p>

<p>For a second the proper owner of the apartment knew not
who this new tenant might be&mdash;he being dark against the
light; but the next second he had recognized him, and
that with no good grace.</p>

<p>"What the devil brings you here?" said he, sulkily.</p>

<p>"A hearty welcome, truly!" the other said, with much
complacency. "After all my vexation in finding thee out!
A goodly welcome for an old friend! But no matter, Jack&mdash;come,
hast naught to offer one to drink? I have ridden
from Banbury this morning; and the plague take me if I
had not enough trouble ere I found the hare in her form.
But 'tis snug&mdash;'tis snug. The place likes me; though I
thought by now you might have company, and entered
with care. Come, man, be more friendly! Will you not
ask me to sit? Must I call the landlady&mdash;or the farmer's
wife&mdash;myself, and beg for a cup of something on so hot a
day? Where be your manners, Gentleman Jack?"</p>

<p>"What the devil brings you into Warwickshire?" the
other repeated, as he threw his hat on the table, and
dropped into a chair, and stretched out his legs, without a
further look at his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>"Nay, 'tis what the devil keeps thee here&mdash;that is the
graver question&mdash;though I know the answer right well.
Come, Jack, be reasonable! 'Tis for thy good I have
sought thee out. What, man, would you ruin us both?&mdash;for
I tell thee, the end is pressing and near."</p>

<p>Seeing that his unwilling host would not even turn his
eyes toward him, he got down from the window-sill, and
came along to the table, and took a chair. He was a
short, stout young man, of puffy face and red hair, good-natured
in look, but with a curious glaze in his light blue-gray
eyes that told of the tavern and himself being pretty
close companions. His dress had some show of ornament
about it, though it was rather travel-stained and shabby;
he wore jewelled rings in his ears; and the handkerchief
which he somewhat ostentatiously displayed, if the linen
might have been whiter, was elaborately embroidered
with thread of Coventry blue. For the rest, he spoke
pleasantly and good-humoredly, and was obviously determined
not to take offence at his anything but hearty reception.</p>

<p>"Hoy-day," said he, with a laugh, "what a bother I
had with the good dame here, that would scarce let me
come in! For how knew I what name you might be
dancing your latest galliard in?&mdash;not plain Jack Orridge,
I'll be bound!&mdash;what is't, your worship?&mdash;or your lordship,
perchance?&mdash;nay, but a lord would look best in the
eyes of a daughter of Will Shakespeare, that loveth to
have trumpets and drums going, and dukes and princes
stalking across his boards. But 'fore Heaven, now, Jack,"
said he, interrupting himself, and sending an appealing
look round the room, "have you naught to drink in the
house? Came you ever to my lodging and found such
scurvy entertainment?"</p>

<p>The reluctant host left the apartment for a second or
two, and presently returned, followed by the farmer's wife,
who placed on the table a jug of small beer, and some
bread and cheese. The bread and cheese did not find
much favor with the new-comer, but he drank a large
horn of the beer, and took to his pipe again.</p>

<p>"Come, Jack, be friendly," said he; "'tis for thine
own good I have sought thee out."</p>

<p>"I would you would mind your own business," the other
said, with a sullen frown remaining on his face.</p>

<p>"Mine and yours are one, as I take it, good coz," his
companion said, coolly; and then he added in a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>friendly way: "Come, come, man, you know we must
sink or swim together. And sinking it will be, if you
give not up this madcap chase. Nay, you carry the jest
too far, <i>mon ami</i>. 'Twas a right merry tale at the beginning&mdash;the
sham wizard, and your coquetting with Will
Shakespeare's daughter to while away the time; 'twas a
prank would make them roar at the Cranes in the Vintry;
and right well done, I doubt not&mdash;for, in truth, if you
were not such a gallant gentleman, you might win to a
place in the theatres as well as any of them; but to come
back here again&mdash;to hide yourself away again&mdash;and when
I tell you they will no longer forbear, but will clap thee
into jail if they have not their uttermost penny&mdash;why, 'tis
pure moonshine madness to risk so much for a jest!"</p>

<p>"I tell thee 'tis no jest at all!" the other said, angrily.
"In Heaven's name, what brought you here?"</p>

<p>"Am I to have no care of myself, then, that am your
surety, and have their threats from hour to hour?"</p>

<p>He laughed in a stupid kind of way, and filled out some
more beer and drank it off thirstily.</p>

<p>"We had a merry night, last night, at Banbury," said
he. "I must pluck a hair of the same wolf to-day. And
what say you? No jest? Nay, you look sour enough to
be virtuous, by my life, or to get into a pulpit and preach
a sermon against fayles and tick-tack, as wiles of the devil.
No jest? Have you been overthrown at last&mdash;by a country
wench? Must you take to the plough, and grow
turnips? Why, I should as soon expect to see Gentleman
Jack consort with the Finsbury archers, or go a-ducking
to Islington ponds! Our Gentleman Jack a farmer! The
price of wheat, goodman Dickon?&mdash;how fatten your pigs?&mdash;will
the fine weather last, think you? Have done with
this foolery, man! If all comes to the worst, 'twere better
we should take to the road, you and I, and snip a purse
when chance might serve."</p>

<p>"You?" said his companion, with only half-concealed
contempt. "The first click of a pistol would find you behind
a hedge."</p>

<p>"Why, old lad," said the other (who did not seem to
have heard that remark, during his pouring out of another
hornful of beer), "I know you better than you
know yourself. This time, you say, 'tis serious&mdash;ay, but
how many times before hast thou said the same? And
ever the wench is the fairest of her kind, and a queen?
For how long?&mdash;a <span class="err" title="original: fornight">fortnight</span>!&mdash;perchance three weeks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>Oh, the wonder of her! And 'tis all a love-worship; and
the praising of her hands and ankles; and Tom Morley's
ditty about a lover and his lass,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That through the green corn fields did pass<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the pretty spring-time,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Ring-a-ding-ding!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ay, for a fortnight; and then Gentleman Jack discovers
that some wench of the Bankside hath brighter eyes and
freer favors than the country beauty, and you hear no
more of him until he has ne'er a penny left, and comes
begging his friends to be surety for him, or to write to his
grandam at Oxford, saying how virtuous a youth he is,
and in how sad a plight. Good Lord, that were an end!&mdash;should
you have to go back to the old dame at last, and
become tapster&mdash;no more acting of your lordship and
worship&mdash;what ho, there! thou lazy knave, a flask of
Rhenish, and put speed into thy rascal heels!"</p>

<p>The cloud on his companion's face had been darkening.</p>

<p>"Peace, drunken fool!" he muttered&mdash;but between his
teeth, for he did not seem to wish to anger this stranger.</p>

<p>"Come, come, man," the other said, jovially, "unwitch
thee! unwitch thee! Fetch back thy senses. What?&mdash;wouldst
thou become a jest and byword for every tavern
table between the Temple and the Tower? Nay, I cannot
believe it of thee, Jack. Serious? Ay, as you have
been twenty times before. Lord, what a foot and ankle!&mdash;and
she the queen o' the world&mdash;the rose and crown
and queen o' the world&mdash;and the sighing o' moonlight
nights&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Mignonne, tant je vous aime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais vous ne m'aimez pas'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and we are all to be virtuous and live cleanly for the rest
of our lives; but the next time you see Gentleman Jack,
lo, you, now!&mdash;'tis at the Bear-house; his pockets lined
with angels wrung from old Ely of Queenhithe; and as
for his company&mdash;Lord! Lord! And as it hath been before,
so 'twill be again, as said Solomon the wise man;
only that this time&mdash;mark you now, Jack&mdash;this time it
were well if you came to your senses at once; for I tell
thee that Ely and the rest of them have lost all patience,
and they know this much of thy Stratford doings, that if
they cannot exactly name thy whereabout, they can come
within a stone's-cast of thee. And if I come to warn thee&mdash;as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>is the office of a true friend and an old companion&mdash;why
shouldst thou sit there with a sulky face, man? Did
I ever treat thee so in Fetter Lane?"</p>

<p>While he had been talking, a savory odor had begun to
steal into the apartment, and presently the farmer's wife
appeared, and proceeded to spread the cloth for dinner.
Her lodger had given no orders; but she had taken his
return as sufficient signal, and naturally she assumed that
his friend would dine with him. Accordingly, in due
course, there was placed on the board a smoking dish of
cow-heel and bacon, with abundance of ale and other garnishings;
and as this fare seemed more tempting to the
new-comer than the bread and cheese, he needed no pressing
to draw his chair to the table. It was not a sumptuous
feast; but it had a beneficial effect on both of them&mdash;sobering
the one, and rendering the other somewhat more
placable. Master Leofric Hope&mdash;as he had styled himself&mdash;was
still in a measure taciturn; but his guest&mdash;whose
name, it appeared, was Francis Lloyd&mdash;had ceased his uncomfortable
banter; and indeed all his talk now was of the
charms and wealth of a certain widow who lived in a
house near to Gray's Inn, on the road to Hampstead. He
had been asked to dine with the widow; and he gave a
magniloquent description of the state she kept&mdash;of her
serving-men, and her furniture, and her plate, and the
manner in which she entertained her friends.</p>

<p>"And why was I," said he&mdash;"why was poor Frank Lloyd&mdash;that
could scarce get the wherewithal to pay for a rose
for his ear&mdash;why was he picked out for so great a favor?
Why, but that he was known to be a friend of handsome
Jack Orridge. 'Where be your friend Master Orridge,
now?' she says, for she hath sometimes a country trick in
her speech, hath the good lady. 'Business, madam&mdash;affairs
of great import,' I say to her, 'keep him still in the
country.' Would I tell her the wolves were waiting to
rend you should you be heard of anywhere within London
city? 'Handsome Jack, they call him, is't not so?' says
she. Would I tell her thou wert called 'Gentleman Jack?'
as if thou hadst but slim right to the title. Then says she
to one of the servants, 'Fill the gentleman's cup.' Lord,
Jack, what a sherris that was!&mdash;'twas meat and drink; a
thing to put marrow in your bones&mdash;cool and clear it was,
and rich withal&mdash;cool on the tongue and warm in the
stomach. 'Fore Heaven, Jack, if thou hast not ever a cup
of that wine ready for me when I visit thee, I will say thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>hast no more gratitude than a toad. And then says she
to all the company (raising her glass the while), 'Absent
friends;' but she nods and smiles to me, as one would say:
'We know whom we mean; we know.' Lord, that sherris,
Jack! I have the taste of it in my mouth now; I dream
o' nights there is a jug of it by me."</p>

<p>"Dreaming or waking, there is little else in thy head,"
said the other; "nor in thy stomach, either."</p>

<p>"Is it a bargain, Jack?" he said, looking up from his
plate and regarding his companion with a fixed look.</p>

<p>"A bargain?"</p>

<p>"I tell thee 'tis the only thing will save us now." This
Frank Lloyd said with more seriousness than he had hitherto
shown. "Heavens, man, you must cease this idling;
I tell thee they are not in the frame for further delay.
'Tis the Widow Becket or the King's highway, one or
t'other, if you would remain a free man; and as for the
highway, why, 'tis an uncertain trade, and I know that
Gentleman Jack is no lover of broken heads. What else
would you? Live on in a hole like this? Nay, but they
would not suffer you. I tell you they are ready to hunt
you out at this present moment. Go beyond seas? Ay,
and forsake the merry nights at the Cranes and the Silver
Hind? When thy old grandam is driven out of all patience,
and will not even forth with a couple of shillings to buy
you wine and radish for your breakfast, 'tis a bad case.
Wouldst go down to Oxford and become tapster?&mdash;Gentleman
Jack, that all of them think hath fine fat acres in
the west country, and a line of ancestors reaching back to
Noah the sailor or Adam gardener. Come, man, unwitch
thee! Collect thy senses. If this sorry jest of thine be
growing serious&mdash;and I confess I had some thought of it,
when you would draw on Harry Condell for the mere
naming of the wench's name&mdash;then, o' Heaven's name,
come away and get thee out of such foolery! I tell thee
thou art getting near an end, o' one way or another; and
wouldst thou have me broken too, that have ever helped
thee, and shared my last penny with thee?"</p>

<p>"Broken?" said his friend, with a laugh. "If there be
any in the country more broken than you and I are at this
moment, Frank, I wish them luck of their fortunes. But
still there is somewhat for you. You have not pawned
those jewels in your ears yet. And your horse&mdash;you rode
hither, said you not?&mdash;well, I trust it is a goodly beast, for
it may have to save thee from starvation ere long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>"Nay, ask me not how I came by the creature," said he,
"but 'tis not mine, I assure ye."</p>

<p>"Whose, then?"</p>

<p>Master Frank Lloyd shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"If you cannot guess my errand," said he, "you cannot
guess who equipped me."</p>

<p>"Nay," said his friend, who was now in a much better
humor, "read me no riddles, Frank. I would fain know
who knew thee so little as to lend thee a horse and see
thee ride forth with it. Who was't, Frank?"</p>

<p>His companion looked up and regarded him.</p>

<p>"The Widow Becket," he answered, coolly.</p>

<p>"What?" said the other, laughing. "Art thou so far
in the good dame's graces, and yet would have me go to
London and marry her?"</p>

<p>"'Tis no laughing matter, Master Jack, as you may find
out ere long," the other said. "The good lady lent me
the horse, 'tis true; else how could I have come all the
way into Warwickshire?&mdash;ay, and lent me an angel or two
to appease the villain landlords. I tell thee she is as
bountiful as the day. Lord, what a house!&mdash;I'll take my
oath that Master Butler hath a good fat capon and a bottle
of claret each evening for his supper&mdash;if he have not, his
face belieth him. And think you she would be niggard
with Handsome Jack? Nay, but a gentleman must have
his friends; ay, and his suppers at the tavern, when the
play is over; and store of pieces in his purse to make you
good company. Why, man, thy fame would spread through
the Blackfriars, I warrant you: where is the hostess that
would not simper and ogle and court'sy to Gentleman Jack,
when that he came among them, slapping the purse in his
pouch?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a fair picture," his friend said. "Thy wits have
been sharpened by thy long ride, Frank. And think you
the buxom widow would consent, were one to make bold
and ask her? Nay, nay; 'tis thy dire need hath driven
thee to this excess of fancy."</p>

<p>For answer Master Lloyd proceeded to bring forth a
small box, which he opened, and took therefrom a finger
ring. It was a man's ring, of massive setting; the stone
of a deep blood-red, and graven with an intaglio of a Roman
bust. He pushed it across the table.</p>

<p>"The horse was lent," said he, darkly. "That&mdash;if it
please you&mdash;you may keep and wear."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" Leofric Hope said, in some surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>"'I name no thing, and I mean no thing,'" said he,
quoting a phrase from a popular ballad. "If you understand
not, 'tis a pity. I may not speak more plainly. But
bethink you that poor Frank Lloyd was not likely to have
the means of purchasing thee such a pretty toy, much as
he would like to please his old friend. Nay, canst thou
not see, Jack? 'Tis a message, man! More I may not
say. Take it and wear it, good lad; and come back boldly
to London; and we will face the harpies, and live as free
men, ere a fortnight be over. What?&mdash;must I speak?
Nay, an' you understand not, I will tell no more."</p>

<p>He understood well enough; and he sat for a second or
two moodily regarding the ring; but he did not take it
up. Then he rose from the table, and began to walk up
and down the room.</p>

<p>"Frank," said he, "couldst thou but see this wench&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, spare me the catalogue," his friend answered,
quickly. "I heard thee declare that Ben Jonson had no
words to say how fair she was: would you better his description
and overmaster him? And fair or not fair, 'tis
all the same with thee; any petticoat can bewitch thee out
of thy senses: Black Almaine or New Almaine may be
the tune, but 'tis ever the same dance; and such a heaving
of sighs and despair!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thy gown was of the grassy green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy sleeves of satin hanging by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made thee be our harvest queen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet thou wouldst not love me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">'Tis a pleasant pastime, friend Jack; but there comes an
end. I know not which be the worse, wenches or usurers,
for landing a poor lad in jail; but both together, Jack&mdash;and
that is thy case&mdash;they are not like to let thee escape.
'Tis not to every one in such a plight there cometh a talisman
like that pretty toy there: beshrew me, what a thing
it is in this world to have a goodly presence!"</p>

<p>He now rose from the table and went to the door, and
called aloud for some one to bring him a light. When that
was brought, and his pipe set going, he sat him down on
the bench by the empty fire-place, for the seat seemed
comfortable, and there he smoked with much content,
while his friend continued to pace up and down the apartment,
meditating over his own situation, and seemingly
not over well pleased with the survey.</p>

<p>Presently something in one of the pigeon-holes over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>fire-place attracted the attention of the visitor; and having
nothing better to do (for he would leave his friend time to
ponder over what he had said), he rose and pulled forth a
little bundle of sheets of paper that opened in his hand as
he sat down again.</p>

<p>"What's this, Jack?" said he. "Hast become playwright?
Surely all of this preachment is not in praise of
the fair damsel's eyebrows?"</p>

<p>His friend turned round, saw what he had got hold of,
and laughed.</p>

<p>"That, now," said he, "were something to puzzle the
wits with, were one free to go to London. I had some
such jest in mind; but perchance 'twas more of idleness
that made me copy out the play."</p>

<p>"'Tis not yours, then? Whose?" said Master Frank
Lloyd, looking over the pages with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"Whose? Why, 'tis by one Will Shakespeare, that you
may have heard of. Would it not puzzle them, Frank?
Were it not a good jest, now, to lay it before some learned
critic and ask his worship's opinion? Or to read it at the
Silver Hind as of thy writing? Would not Dame Margery
weep with joy? Out upon the Mermaid!&mdash;have we not
poets of our own?"</p>

<p>He had drawn near, and was looking down at the sheets
that his friend was examining.</p>

<p>"I tell thee this, Jack," the latter said, in his cool way,
"there is more than a jest to be got out of a play by Will
Shakespeare. Would not the booksellers give us the price
of a couple of nags for it if we were pressed so far?"</p>

<p>"Mind thine own business, fool!" was the angry rejoinder;
and ere he knew what had happened his hands were empty.</p>

<hr class="l5" />

<p>And at that same moment, away over there in Stratford
town, Judith was in the garden, trying to teach little Bess
Hall to dance, and merrily laughing the while. And when
the dancing lesson was over she would try a singing lesson;
and now the child was on Judith's shoulder, and had
hold of her bonny sun-brown curls.</p>

<p>"Well done, Bess; well done! Now again&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>AN APPEAL.</h3>

<p>Great changes were in store. To begin with, there were
rumors of her father being about to return to London.
Then Dr. Hall was summoned away into Worcestershire
by a great lady living there, who was continually fancying
herself at the brink of death, and manifesting on such occasions
a terror not at all in consonance with her professed
assurance that she was going to a happier sphere. As it
was possible that Dr. Hall would seize this opportunity
to pay several other professional visits in the neighboring
county, it was proposed that Susan and her daughter
should come for a while to New Place, and that Judith
should at the same time go and stay with her grandmother
at Shottery, to cheer the old dame somewhat. And so it
happened, on this July morning, that Judith's mother having
gone round to see her elder daughter about all these
arrangements, Judith found herself not only alone in the
house, but, as rarely chanced, with nothing to do.</p>

<p>She tried to extract some music from her sister's lute,
but that was a failure; she tried half a dozen other things;
and then it occurred to her&mdash;for the morning was fine and
clear, and she was fond of the meadows and of open air
and sunlight&mdash;that she would walk round to the grammar
school and beg for a half-holiday for Willie Hart. He, as
well as Bess Hall, was under her tuition; and there were
things she could teach him of quite as much value (as she
considered) as anything to be learned at a desk. At the
same time, before going to meet the staring eyes of all
those boys, she thought she might as well repair to her
own room and smarten up her attire&mdash;even to the extent,
perhaps, of putting on her gray beaver hat with the row
of brass beads.</p>

<p>That was not at all necessary. Nothing of the kind was
needful to make Judith Shakespeare attractive and fascinating
and wonderful to that crowd of lads. The fact was,
the whole school of them were more or less secretly in
love with her; and this, so far from procuring Willie Hart
such bumps and thrashings that he might have received
from a solitary rival, gained for him; on the contrary, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>mysterious favor and good-will that showed itself in a hundred
subtle ways. For he was in a measure the dispenser
of Judith's patronage. When he was walking along the
street with her he would tell her the name of this one or
that of his companions (in case she had forgotten), and she
would stop and speak to him kindly, and hope he was getting
on well with his tasks. Also the other lads, on the
strength of Willie Hart's intermediation, would now make
bold to say, with great politeness, "Give ye good-morrow,
Mistress Judith," when they met her, and sometimes she
would pause for a moment and chat with one of them,
and make some inquiries of him as to whether her cousin
did not occasionally need a little help in his lessons from
the bigger boys. Then there was a kind of fury of assistance
instantly promised; and the youth would again remember
his good manners, and bid her formally farewell, and go
on his way, with his heart and his cheeks alike afire, and
his brain gone a-dancing. Even that dread being, the
head-master, had no frown for her when she went boldly
up to his desk, in the very middle of the day's duties, to
demand some favor. Nay, he would rather detain her
with a little pleasant conversation, and would at times become
almost facetious (at sight of which the spirits of the
whole school rose into a seventh heaven of equanimity).
And always she got what she wanted; and generally, before
leaving, she would give one glance down the rows of
oaken benches, singling out her friends here and there,
and, alas! not thinking at all of the deadly wounds she
was thus dealing with those lustrous and shining eyes.</p>

<p>Well, on this morning she had no difficulty in rescuing
her cousin from the dull captivity of the school-room;
and hand in hand they went along and down to the river-side
and to the meadows there. But seemingly she had no
wish to get much farther from the town; for the truth was
that she lacked assurance as yet that Master Leofric Hope
had left that neighborhood; and she was distinctly of a
mind to avoid all further communications with him until,
if ever, he should be able to come forward openly and declare
himself to the small world in which she lived. Accordingly
she did not lead Willie Hart far along the river-side
path; they rather kept to seeking about the banks
and hedge-rows for wild flowers&mdash;the pink and white bells
of the bind-weed she was mostly after, and these did not
abound there&mdash;until at last they came to a stile; and there
she sat down, and would have her cousin sit beside her, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>that she should give him some further schooling as to all
that he was to do and think and be in the coming years.
She had far other things than Lilly's Grammar to teach
him. The Sententi Pueriles contained no instruction as
to how, for example, a modest and well-conducted youth
should approach his love-maiden to discover whether her
heart was well inclined toward him. And although her
timid-eyed pupil seemed to take but little interest in the
fair creature that was thus being provided for him in the
future, and was far more anxious to know how he was to
win Judith's approval, either now or then, still he listened
contentedly enough, for Judith's voice was soft and musical.
Nay, he put that imaginary person out of his mind altogether.
It was Judith, and Judith alone, whom he saw
in these forecasts. Would he have any other supplant her
in his dreams and visions of what was to be? This world
around him&mdash;the smooth-flowing Avon, the wooded banks,
the wide white skies, the meadows and fields and low-lying
hills: was not she the very spirit and central life and light
of all these? Without her, what would these be?&mdash;dead
things; the mystery and wonder gone out of them; a
world in darkness. But he could not think of that; the
world he looked forward to was filled with light, for Judith
was there, the touch of her hand as gentle as ever, her
eyes still as kind.</p>

<p>"So must you be accomplished at all points, sweetheart,"
she was continuing, "that you shame her not in any company,
whatever the kind of it may be. If they be grave,
and speak of the affairs of the realm, then must you know
how the country is governed, as becomes a man (though,
being a woman, alack! I cannot help you there), and you
must have opinions about what is best for England, and be
ready to uphold them, too. Then, if the company be of a
gayer kind, again you shall not shame her, but take part
in all the merriment; and if there be dancing, you shall
not go to the door, and hang about like a booby; you must
know the new dances, every one; for would you have your
sweetheart dance with others, and you standing by? That
were a spite, I take it, for both of you!&mdash;nay, would not
the wench be angry to be so used? Let me see, now&mdash;what
is the name of it?&mdash;the one that is danced to the tune
of 'The Merchant's Daughter went over the Field?'&mdash;have
I shown you that, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"I know not, Cousin Judith," said he.</p>

<p>"Come, then," said she, blithely; and she took him by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>the hand and placed him opposite her in the meadow.
"Look you, now, the four at the top cross hands&mdash;so (you
must imagine the other two, sweetheart); and all go round
once&mdash;so; and then they change hands, and go back the
other way&mdash;so; and then each takes his own partner, and
away they go round the circle, and back to their place.
Is it not simple, cousin? Come, now, let us try properly."</p>

<p>And so they began again; and for music she lightly
hummed a verse of a song that was commonly sung to the
same tune:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Maid, will you love me, yes or no?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me the truth, and let me go.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The other hand, Willie&mdash;quick!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It can be no less than a sinful deed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Trust me truly)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To linger a lover that looks to speed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(In due time duly).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Why, is it not simple!" she said, laughing. "But
now, instead of crossing hands, I think it far the prettier
way that they should hold their hands up together&mdash;so:
shall we try it, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>And then she had to sing another verse of the ballad:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Consider, sweet, what sighs and sobs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do nip my heart with cruel throbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all, my dear, for the love of you<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Trust me truly);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I hope that you will some mercy show<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(In due time duly).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And then," she continued, when they had finished that
laughing rehearsal, "should the fiddles begin to squeal and
screech&mdash;which is as much as to say, 'Now, all of you, kiss
your partners!'&mdash;then shall you not bounce forward and
seize the wench by the neck, as if you were a ploughboy
besotted with ale, and have her hate thee for destroying
her head-gear and her hair. No, you shall come forward
in this manner, as if to do her great courtesy, and you shall
take her hand and bend one knee&mdash;and make partly a jest
of it, but not altogether a jest&mdash;and then you shall kiss her
hand, and rise and retire. Think you the maiden will not
be proud that you have shown her so much honor and respect
in public?&mdash;ay, and when she and you are thereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>together, by yourselves, I doubt not but that she may
be willing to make up to you for your forbearance and
courteous treatment of her. Marry, with that I have naught
to do; 'tis as the heart of the wench may happen to be inclined;
though you may trust me she will be well content
that you show her other than ale-house manners; and if
'tis but a matter of a kiss that you forego, because you
would pay her courtesy in public, why, then, as I say, she
may make that up to thee, or she is no woman else. I wonder,
now, what the Bonnybel will be like&mdash;or tall, or dark,
or fair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish never to see her, Judith," said he, simply.</p>

<p>However, there was to be no further discussion of this
matter, nor yet greensward rehearsals of dancing; for they
now descried coming to them the little maid who waited
on Judith's grandmother. She seemed in a hurry, and had
a basket over her arm.</p>

<p>"How now, little Cicely?" Judith said, as she drew near.</p>

<p>"I have sought you everywhere, so please you, Mistress
Judith," the little maid said, breathlessly, "for I was coming
in to the town&mdash;on some errands&mdash;and&mdash;and I met the
stranger gentleman that came once or twice to the house&mdash;and&mdash;and
he would have me carry a message to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prithee, good lass," said Judith, instantly, and with
much composure, "go thy way back home. I wish for no
message."</p>

<p>"He seemed in sore distress," the little maid said, diffidently.</p>

<p>"How, then? Did a gentleman of his tall inches seek
help from such a mite as thou?"</p>

<p>"He would fain see you, sweet mistress, and but for a
moment," the girl answered, being evidently desirous of
getting the burden of the message off her mind. "He bid
me say he would be in the lane going to Bidford, or thereabout,
for the next hour or two, and would crave a word
with you&mdash;out of charity, the gentleman said, or something
of the like&mdash;and that it might be the last chance of seeing
you ere he goes, and that I was to give his message to you
very secretly."</p>

<p>Well, she scarcely knew what to do. At their last interview
he had pleaded for another opportunity of saying
farewell to her, and she had not definitely refused; but, on
the other hand, she would much rather have seen nothing
further of him in these present circumstances. His half-reckless
references to Prince Ferdinand undergoing any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>kind of hardship for the sake of winning the fair Miranda
were of a dangerous cast. She did not wish to meet him
on that ground at all, even to have her suspicions removed.
But if he were really in distress? And this his last day in
the neighborhood? It seemed a small matter to grant.</p>

<p>"What say you, Cousin Willie?" said she, good-naturedly.
"Shall we go and see what the gentleman would
have of us? I cannot, unless with thee as my shield and
champion."</p>

<p>"If you wish it, Cousin Judith," said he: what would he
not do that she wished?</p>

<p>"And Cicely&mdash;shall we all go?"</p>

<p>"Nay, so please you, Mistress Judith," the girl said; "I
have to go back for my errands. I have been running
everywhere to seek you."</p>

<p>"Then, Willie, come along," said she, lightly. "We
must get across the fields to the Evesham road."</p>

<p>And so the apple-cheeked little maiden trudged back to
the town with her basket, while Judith and her companion
went on their way across the meadows. There was a kind
of good-humored indifference in her consent, though she
felt anxious that the interview should be as brief as possible.
She had had more time of late to think over all the
events that had recently happened&mdash;startling events enough
in so quiet and even a life; and occasionally she bethought
her of the wizard, and of the odd coincidence of her meeting
this young gentleman at the very spot that had been
named. She had tried to laugh aside certain recurrent
doubts and surmises, and was only partially successful.
And she had a vivid recollection of the relief she had experienced
when their last interview came to an end.</p>

<p>"You must gather me some flowers, sweetheart," said
she, "while I am speaking to this gentleman; perchance
he may have something to say of his own private affairs."</p>

<p>"I will go on to your grandmother's garden," said he,
"if you wish it, Cousin Judith, and get you the flowers
there."</p>

<p>"Indeed, no," she answered, patting him on the shoulder.
"Would you leave me without my champion? Nay, but
if you stand aside a little, that the gentleman may speak
in confidence, if that be his pleasure, surely that will be
enough."</p>

<p>They had scarcely entered the lane when he made his
appearance, and the moment she set eyes on him she saw
that something had happened. His face seemed haggard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>and anxious&mdash;nay, his very manner was changed; where
was the elaborate courtesy with which he had been wont
to approach her?</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, hurriedly, "I must risk all now. I
must speak plain. I&mdash;I scarce hoped you would give me
the chance."</p>

<p>But she was in no alarm.</p>

<p>"Now, sweetheart," said she, calmly, to the little lad,
"you may get me the flowers; and if you find any more
of the bind-weed bells and the St. John's wort, so much the
better."</p>

<p>Then she turned to Master Leofric Hope.</p>

<p>"I trust you have had no ill news," said she, but in a
kind way.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have. Well, I know not which way to take
it," he said, in a sort of desperate fashion. "It might be
good news. But I am hard pressed; 'twill be sink or
swim with me presently. Well, there is one way of safety
opened to me: 'tis for you to say whether I shall take it
or not."</p>

<p>"I, sir?" she said; and she was so startled that she almost
recoiled a step.</p>

<p>"Nay, but first I must make a confession," said he,
quickly, "whatever comes of it. Think of me what you
will, I will tell you the truth. Shall I beg for your forgiveness
beforehand?"</p>

<p>He was regarding her earnestly and anxiously, and there
was nothing but kindness and a dim expression of concern
in his honest, frank face and in the beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"No, I will not," he said. "Doubtless you will be angry,
and with just cause; and you will go away. Well,
this is the truth. The devils of usurers were after me; I
had some friends not far from here; I escaped to them;
and they sought out this hiding for me. Then I had heard of
you&mdash;you will not forgive me, but this is the truth&mdash;I had
heard of your beauty; and Satan himself put it into my
head that I must see you. I thought it would be a pastime,
to while away this cursed hiding, if I could get to
know you without discovering myself. I sent you a message.
I was myself the wizard. Heaven is my witness
that when I saw you at the corner of the field up there,
and heard you speak, and looked on your gracious and
gentle ways, remorse went to my heart; but how could I
forego seeking to see you again? It was a stupid jest.
It was begun in thoughtlessness; but now the truth is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>before you: I was myself the wizard; and&mdash;and my name
is not Leofric Hope, but John Orridge&mdash;a worthless poor
devil that is ashamed to stand before you."</p>

<p>Well, the color had mounted to her face: for she saw
clearly the invidious position that this confession had
placed her in; but she was far less startled than he had
expected. She had already regarded this trick as a possible
thing, and she had also fully considered what she
ought to do in such circumstances. Now, when the circumstances
were actually laid before her, she made no display
of wounded pride, or of indignant anger, or anything
of the kind.</p>

<p>"I pray you," said she, with a perfect and simple dignity,
"pass from that. I had no such firm belief in the
wizard's prophecies. I took you as you represented yourself
to be, a stranger, met by chance, one who was known
to my father's friends, and who was in misfortune; and if
I have done aught beyond what I should have done in
such a pass, I trust you will put it down to our country
manners, that are perchance less guarded than those of
the town."</p>

<p>For an instant&mdash;there was not the slightest doubt of it&mdash;actual
tears stood in the young man's eyes.</p>

<p>"By heavens," he exclaimed, "I think you must be the
noblest creature God ever made! You do not drive me
away in scorn; you have no reproaches? And I&mdash;to be
standing here&mdash;telling you such a tale&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir, pass from that," said she. "What
of your own fortune? You are quitting the neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"But how can you believe me in anything, since you
know how I have deceived you?" said he, as if he could
not understand how she should make no sign of her displeasure.</p>

<p>"'Twas but a jest, as you say," she answered, good-naturedly,
but still with a trifle of reserve. "And no harm
has come of it. I would leave it aside, good sir."</p>

<p>"Harm?" said he, regarding her with a kind of anxious
timidity. "That may or may not be, sweet lady, as time
will show. If I dared but speak to you&mdash;well, bethink
you of my meeting you here from day to day, in these
quiet retreats, and seeing such a sweetness and beauty
and womanliness as I have never met in the world before&mdash;such
a wonder of gentleness and kindness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would ask you to spare me these compliments," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>she, simply. "I thought 'twas some serious matter you
had in hand."</p>

<p>"Serious enough i' faith!" he said, in an altered tone,
as if she had recalled him to a sense of the position in
which he stood. "But there is the one way out of it,
after all. I can sell my life away for money to pacify
those fiends; nay, besides that, I should live in abundance,
doubtless, and be esteemed a most fortunate gentleman,
and one to be envied. A gilded prison-house and
slavery; but what would the fools think of that if they
saw me with a good fat purse at the tavern?"</p>

<p>Again he regarded her.</p>

<p>"There is another way yet, however, if I must needs
trouble you, dear Mistress Judith, with my poor affairs.
What if I were to break with that accursed London altogether,
and go off and fight my way in another country,
as many a better man hath done? ay, and there be still
one or two left who would help me to escape if they saw me
on the way to reform, as they would call it. And what
would I not do in that way&mdash;ay, or in any way&mdash;if I could
hope for a certain prize to be won at the end of it all?"</p>

<p>"And that, good sir?"</p>

<p>"That," said he, watching her face&mdash;"the reward that
would be enough and more than enough for all I might
suffer would be just this&mdash;to find Judith Shakespeare
coming to meet me in this very lane."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," was her immediate and incoherent exclamation;
and then she promptly pulled herself together,
and said, with some touch of pride: "Indeed, good sir,
you talk wildly. I scarce understand how you can be in
such grave trouble."</p>

<p>"Then," said he, and he was rather pale, and spoke
slowly, "it would be no manner of use for any poor Ferdinand
of these our own days to go bearing logs or suffering
any hardships that might arise? There would be no
Miranda waiting for him, after all?"</p>

<p>She colored deeply; she could not affect to misunderstand
the repeated allusion; and all she had in her mind
now was to leave him and get away from him, and yet
without unkindness or anger.</p>

<p>"Good sir," said she, with such equanimity as she could
muster, "if that be your meaning&mdash;if that be why you
wished to see me again&mdash;and no mere continuance of an
idle jest, plain speech will best serve our turn. I trust no
graver matters occupy your mind; as for this, you must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>put that away. It was with no thought of any such thing
that I&mdash;that I met you once or twice, and&mdash;and lent you
such reading as might pass the time for you. And perchance
I was too free in that, and in my craving to hear
of my father and his friends in London, and the rest. But
what you say now, if I understand you aright&mdash;well, I had
no thought of any such thing. Indeed, good sir, if I have
done wrong in listening to you about my father's friends,
'twas in the hope that soon or late you would continue the
tale in my father's house. But now&mdash;what you say&mdash;bids
me to leave you&mdash;and yet in no anger&mdash;for in truth I wish
you well."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, and he held it for a moment.</p>

<p>"Is this your last word, Judith?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, indeed," she answered, rather breathlessly
and earnestly. "I may not see you again. I pray
Heaven your troubles may soon be over; and perchance
you may meet my father in London, and become one of
his friends; then might I hear of your better fortunes.
'Twould be welcome news, believe me. And now fare
you well."</p>

<p>He stooped to touch her hand with his lips; but he said
not a word; and she turned away without raising her eyes.
He stood there motionless and silent, watching her and
the little boy as they walked along the lane toward the
village&mdash;regarding them in an absent kind of way, and
yet with no great expression of sadness or hopelessness in
his face. Then he turned and made for the highway to
Bidford; and he was saying to himself as he went along:</p>

<p>"Well, there goes one chance in life, for good or ill.
And what if I had been more persistent? What if she had
consented, or even half consented, or said that in the future
I might come back with some small modicum of hope?
Nay: the devil only knows where I should get logs to carry
for the winning of so fair a reward. Frank Lloyd is
right. My case is too desperate. So fare you well, sweet
maiden; keep you to your quiet meadows and your wooded
lanes: and the clown that will marry you will give
you a happier life than ever you could have had with Jack
Orridge and his broken fortunes."</p>

<p>Indeed, he seemed in no downcast mood. As he walked
along the highway he was absently watching the people
in the distant fields, or idly whistling the tune of "Calen
o Custure me." But by and by, as he drew near the farm,
his face assumed a more sombre look; and when, coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>still nearer, he saw Frank Lloyd calmly standing at the
door of the stables, smoking his pipe, there was a sullen
frown on his forehead that did not promise well for the
cheerfulness of that journey to London which Master Lloyd
had sworn he would not undertake until his friend was
ready to accompany him.</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>TO LONDON TOWN.</h3>

<p>But that was not the departure for London which was
soon to bring Judith a great heaviness of heart, and cause
many a bitter fit of crying when that she was lying awake
o' nights. She would rather have let all her lovers go,
and welcome, a hundred times over. But, as the days
passed, it became more and more evident, from certain
preparations, that her father was about to leave Stratford
for the south, and finally the very moment was fixed. Judith
strove to keep a merry face (for so she had been bid),
but again and again she was on the point of going to him
and falling on her knees and begging him to remain with
them. She knew that he would laugh at her; but did he
quite know what going away from them meant? And the
use of it? Had they not abundance? Still, she was afraid
of being chid for meddling in matters beyond her; and so
she went about her duties with as much cheerfulness as
she could assume; though, when in secret conclave with
Prudence, and talking of this, and what the house would
be like when he was gone, quiet tears would steal down
her face in the dusk.</p>

<p>To suit the convenience of one or two neighbors, who
were also going to London, the day of departure had been
postponed; but at last the fatal morning arrived. Judith,
from an early hour, was on the watch, trying to get some
opportunity of saying good-by to her father by herself
(and not before all the strangers who would soon be gathering
together), but always she was defeated, for he was busy
in-doors with many things, and every one was lending a
helping hand. Moreover, she was in an excited and trembling
state; and more than once she had to steal away to
her chamber and bathe her eyes with water lest that they
should tell any tale when he regarded her. But the climax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>of her misfortunes was this. When the hour for leaving
was drawing nigh she heard him go out and into the garden,
doubtless with the intention of locking up the cupboard
in the summer-house; and so she presently and
swiftly stole out after him, thinking that now would be her
chance. Alas! the instant she had passed through the
back-court door she saw that Matthew gardener had forestalled
her; and not only that, but he had brought a visitor
with him&mdash;the master constable, Grandfather Jeremy,
whom she knew well. Anger filled her heart; but there
was no time to stand on her dignity. She would not retire
from the field. She walked forward boldly, and stood by
her father's side, as much as to say: "Well, this is my place.
What do you want? Why this intrusion at such a time?"</p>

<p>Grandfather Jeremy was a little, thin, round-shouldered
ancient, with long, straggling gray hair, and small, shrewd,
ferret-like eyes that kept nervously glancing from Judith's
father to goodman Matthew, who had obviously introduced
him on this occasion. Indeed, the saturnine visage of the
gardener was overspread with a complacent grin, as though
he were saying, "Look you there, zur, there be a rare
vool." Judith's father, on the other hand, showed no impatience
over this interruption; he kept waiting for the
old man to recover his power of speech.</p>

<p>"Well, now, master constable, what would you?" he
said gently.</p>

<p>"Why can't 'ee tell his worship, Jeremy?" Matthew
gardener said, in his superior and facetious fashion, "Passion
o' me, man, thy tongue will wag fast enough at
Mother Tooley's ale-house."</p>

<p>"It wur a contrevarsie, so please your worship," the
ancient constable said, but with a kind of vacant stare, as
if he were half lost in looking back into his memory.</p>

<p>"Ay, and with whom?" said Judith's father, to help him
along.</p>

<p>"With my poor old woman, so please your worship.
She be a poor, mean creature in your honor's eyes, I make
no doubt; but she hath wisdom, she hath, and a strength
in contrevarsie past most. Lord, Lord, why be I standing
here now&mdash;and holding your worship&mdash;and your worship's
time and necessities&mdash;but that she saith, 'Jeremy, put thy
better leg avore;' 'speak out,' saith she; ''twur as good
for thee as a half-ox in a pie, or a score of angels in thy
pouch.' 'Speak out,' she saith, 'and be not afraid, Jeremy.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>"But, master constable," said Judith's father, "if your
good dame be such a Mary Ambree in argument, she
should have furnished you with fewer words and more
matter. What would you?"</p>

<p>"Nay, zur, I be as bold as most," said the constable,
pulling up his courage, and also elevating his head somewhat
with an air of authority. "I can raise hue and cry
in the hundred, that can I; and if the watch bring me a
rogue, he shall lie by the heels, or I am no true man.
But Lord, zur, have pity on a poor man that be put forward
to speak for a disputation. When they wur talking
of it at furst, your worship&mdash;this one and the other, and
all of them to once&mdash;and would have me go forward to
speak for them, 'Zure,' says I, 'I would as lief go to a
bride-ale with my legs swaddled in wisps as go avore
Mahster Shaksper without a power o' voine words.' But
Joan, she saith, 'Jeremy, fear no man, howsoever great, for
there be but the one Lord over us all; perzent thyself like
a true countryman and an honest officer; take thy courage
with thee,' saith she; 'and remember thou speakest vor
thy friends as well as vor thyself. 'Tis a right good worshipful
gentleman,' she saith, meaning yourself, sweet
Mahster Shaksper; 'and will a not give us a share?'"</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, man," said Judith's father, laughing,
"what would you? Had Joan no clearer message to give
you?"</p>

<p>"I but speak her words, so please your worship," said
the ancient constable, with the air of one desperately trying
to recall a lesson that had been taught him. "And
all of them&mdash;they wur zaying as how she hath a power o'
wisdom&mdash;and, 'Jeremy,' she saith, 'be not overbold with
the worthy gentleman; 'tis but a share; and he be a right
worthy and civil gentleman; speak him fair, Jeremy,' she
saith, 'and put thy better leg avore, and acquit thee as a
man. Nay, be bold,' she saith, 'and think of thy vriends,
that be waiting without for an answer. Think of them,
Jeremy,' she saith, 'if thy speech fail thee. 'Tis but a
share; 'tis but a share; and he a right worshipful and
civil gentleman.'"</p>

<p>Judith's father glanced at the sun-dial on the gable of
the barn.</p>

<p>"My good friend," said he, "I hear that your wife
Joan is ailing; 'tis through no lack of breath, I warrant
me. An you come not to the point forthwith, I must be
gone. What would you? Or what would your good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>dame have of me?&mdash;for there we shall get to it more
quickly."</p>

<p>"So please you, zur," said Matthew, with his complacent
grin, "the matter be like this, now: this worthy master
constable and his comrades of the watch, they wur laying
their heads together like; and they have heard say that
you have written of them, and taken of their wisdom the
couple o' nights they wur brought in to supper; and they
see as how you have grown rich, so please you, zur, with
such writing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A vast o' money&mdash;a vast o' money and lands," the
other murmured.</p>

<p>"And now, zur, they would make bold to ask for their
share, for the help that they have given you. Nay, zur,"
continued Matthew gardener, who was proud of the ease
with which he could put into words the inarticulate desires
of this good constable, "be not angry with worthy
Jeremy; he but speaketh for the others, and for his wife
Joan too, that be as full of courage as any of them, and
would have come to your worship but that she be sore
troubled with an ague. Lord, zur, I know not how much
the worthy gentlemen want. Perchance good Jeremy
would be content wi' the barn and the store of malt in the
malt-house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this the small deep eyes of the ancient began to
twinkle nervously; and he glanced in an anxious way from
one to the other.</p>

<p>"And the watch, now," continued Matthew grinning,
and regarding the old constable; "why, zur, they be poor
men; 'twould go well with them to divide amongst them
the store of good wine in the cellar, and perchance also
the leather hangings that be so much talked of in the
town. But hark you, good Jeremy, remember this, now&mdash;that
whoever hath the garden and orchard fall to his lot
must pay me my wages, else 'tis no bargain."</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Judith saw her father in a
passion of anger. His color did not change; but there
was a strange look about his mouth, and his eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"Thou cursed fool," he said to the gardener, "'tis thou
hast led these poor men into this folly." And then he
turned to the bewildered constable, and took him by the
arm. "Come, good friend," said he, in a kindly way,
"come into the house and I will explain these matters to
thee. Thou hast been mislead by that impudent knave&mdash;by
my life, I will settle that score with him ere long; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>in truth the aid that you and your comrades have given
me is chiefly that we have passed a pleasant evening or
two together, and been merry or wise as occasion offered.
And I would have you spend such another to-night among
yourselves, leaving the charges at the ale-house to me;
and for the present, if I may not divide my store of wine
among you, 'tis no reason why you and I should not have
a parting cup ere I put hand to bridle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was all that Judith heard; and then she turned to
the ancient wise man and said, coolly,</p>

<p>"Were I in thy place, good Matthew, I would get me
out of this garden, and out of Stratford town too, ere my
father come back." And Matthew was too frightened to
answer her.</p>

<p>The outcome of all this, however, was that Judith's
father did not return to the garden; and when she went
into the house she found that he had taken such time to
explain to Jeremy constable how small a share in his writings
had been contributed by these good people that certain
of the members of the expedition bound for London
had already arrived. Indeed, their horses and attendants
were at the door; and all and everything was in such a
state of confusion and uproar that Judith saw clearly she
had no chance of saying a quiet good-by to her father all
by herself. But was she to be again balked by goodman
Matthew? She thought not. She slipped away by the
back door and disappeared.</p>

<p>There was quite a little crowd gathered to see the cavalcade
move off. Dr. Hall was not there, but Tom Quiney
was&mdash;bringing with him as a parting gift for Judith's father
a handsome riding-whip; and the worthy parson Blaise
had also appeared, though there was no opportunity for
his professional services amid so much bustle. And then
there were hand-shakings and kissings and farewells; and
Judith's father was just about to put his foot in the stirrup,
when Susanna called out:</p>

<p>"But where is Judith? Is she not coming to say good-by
to my father?"</p>

<p>Then there were calls for Judith, here, there, and everywhere,
but no answer; and her mother was angry that the
girl should detain all this assemblage. But her father, not
having mounted, went rapidly through the house, and just
opened the door leading into the garden. The briefest
glance showed him that the mastiff was gone. Then he
hurried back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>"'Tis all well, good mother," said he, as he got into the
saddle. "I shall see the wench ere I go far. I know her
tricks."</p>

<p>So the company moved away from the house, and
through the streets, and down to Clopton's bridge. Once
over the bridge, they struck to the right, taking the Oxford
road by Shipston and Enstone; and ere they had gone
far along the highway, Judith's father, who seemed less to
join in the general hilarity and high spirits of the setting
out than to be keeping a watch around, perceived something
in the distance&mdash;at a corner where there was a high
bank behind some trees&mdash;that caused him to laugh slightly,
and to himself. When they were coming near this corner
the figure that had been on the sky-line had disappeared;
but down by the road-side was Judith herself, looking very
tremulous and ashamed as all these people came along,
and the great Don standing by her. Her father, who had
some knowledge of her ways, bade them all ride on, and
then he turned his horse, and sprang down from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Well, wench," said he, and he took her by the shoulders,
"what brings you here?"</p>

<p>In answer, she could only burst into tears, and hide her
face in his breast.</p>

<p>"Why, lass," said he, "what is a journey to London?
And have you not enough left to comfort you? Have you
not sweethearts a plenty?"</p>

<p>But she could not speak; she only sobbed and sobbed.</p>

<p>"Come, come, lass, I must be going," said he, stroking
the soft brown hair. "Cheer up. Wouldst thou spoil
the prettiest eyes in Warwickshire? Nay, an thou have
not a right merry and beaming face when I come again, I
will call thee no daughter of mine."</p>

<p>Then she raised her head&mdash;for still she could not speak&mdash;and
he kissed her.</p>

<p>"Heaven's blessings on thee, good wench! I think 'tis
the last time I shall ever have the courage to leave thee.
Fare you well, sweetheart; keep your eyes bright and
your face happy&mdash;to draw me home again."</p>

<p>Then she kissed him on each cheek, and he got into the
saddle and rode on. She climbed up to the top of the
bank, and watched him and his companions while they
were still in sight, and then she turned to go slowly homeward.</p>

<p>And it seemed to her, when she came in view of Stratford,
and looked down on the wide meadows and the placid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>river and the silent homesteads, that a sort of winter had
already fallen over the land. That long summer had been
very beautiful to her&mdash;full of sunlight and color and the
scent of flowers; but now a kind of winter was come, and
a sadness and loneliness; and the days and days that would
follow each other seemed to have no longer any life in
them.</p>

<hr class="l65" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>EVIL TIDINGS.</h3>

<p>But a far sharper winter than any she had thought of
was now about to come upon her, and this was how it befell:</p>

<p>After the departure of her father, good Master Walter
Blaise became more and more the guide and counsellor of
these women-folk; and indeed New Place was now given
over to meetings for prayer and worship, and was also become
the head-quarters in the town for the entertainment
of travelling preachers, and for the institution of all kinds
of pious and charitable undertakings. There was little
else for the occupants of it to do: the head of the house
was in London; Judith was at Shottery with her grandmother;
Susanna was relieved from much of her own domestic
cares by the absence of her husband in Worcestershire;
and the bailiff looked after all matters pertaining
to the farm. Indeed, so constant were these informal services
and ministerings to pious travellers that Julius Shawe
(though not himself much given in that direction, and perhaps
mostly to please his sister) felt bound to interfere and
offer to open his house on occasion, or pay part of the
charges incurred through this kindly hospitality. Nay, he
went privately to Master Blaise and threw out some vague
hints as to the doubtful propriety of allowing a wife, in
the absence of her husband, to be so ready with her
charity. Now Master Blaise was an honest and straightforward
man, and he met this charge boldly and openly.
He begged of Master Shawe to come to New Place that
very afternoon, when two or three of the neighbors were
to assemble to hear him lecture; and both Prudence and
her brother went. But before the lecture, the parson observed
that he had had a case of conscience put before him&mdash;as
to the giving of alms and charity, by whom, for whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>and on whose authority&mdash;which he would not himself decide.
The whole matter, he observed, had been pronounced
upon in the holiday lectures of that famous divine
Master William Perkins, who was now gone to his
eternal reward; these lectures having recently been given
to the world by the aid of one Thomas Pickering, of Emmanuel
College, Cambridge. And very soon it appeared,
as the young parson read from the little parchment-covered
book, that the passages he quoted had been carefully
chosen and were singularly pertinent. For after a discourse
on the duty of almsgiving, as enjoined by Scripture
(and it was pointed out that Christ himself had lived on
alms&mdash;"not by begging, as the Papists affirm, but by the
voluntary ministration and contribution of some to whom
he preached"), Master Blaise read on, with an occasional
glance at Julius Shawe: "'It may be asked whether the
wife may give alms without the consent of her husband,
considering that she is in subjection to another, and therefore
all that she hath is another's, and not her own. Answer.
The wife may give alms of some things, but with
these cautions: as, first, she may give of those goods that
she hath excepted from marriage. Secondly, she may give
of those things which are common to them both, provided
it be with the husband's consent, at least general and implicit.
Thirdly, she may not give without or against the
consent of her husband. And the reason is, because both
the law of nature and the word of God command her obedience
to her husband in all things. If it be alleged that
Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, with others,
did minister to Christ of their goods (Luke viii., 3), I answer:
It is to be presumed that it was not done without
all consent. Again, if it be said that Abigail brought a
present to David for the relief of him and his young men,
whereof she made not Nabal, her husband, acquainted (1
Sam. xxv., 19), I answer, it is true, but mark the reason.
Nabal was generally of a churlish and unmerciful disposition,
whereupon he was altogether unwilling to yield relief
to any, in how great necessity soever; whence it was
that he railed on the young men that came to him, and
drove them away, ver. 14. Again, he was a foolish man,
and given to drunkenness, so as he was not fit to govern
his house or to dispense his alms. Besides, that Abigail
was a woman of great wisdom in all her actions, and that
which she now did was to save Nabal's and her own life&mdash;yea,
the lives of his whole family; for the case was desperate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>and all that they had were in present hazard. The
example, therefore, is no warrant for any woman to give
alms, unless it be in the like case.'" And then he summed
up in a few words, saying, in effect, that as regards the
question which had been put before him, it was for the
wife to say whether she had her husband's general and implied
consent to her pious expenditure, and to rule her
accordingly.</p>

<p>This completely and forever shut Julius Shawe's mouth.
For he knew, and they all knew, that Judith's father was
well content that any preachers or divines coming to the
house should be generously received; while he on his part
claimed a like privilege in the entertainment of any vagrant
person or persons (especially if they were making a
shift to live by their wits) whom he might chance to meet.
Strict economy in all other things was the rule of the
household; in the matter of hospitality the limits were
wide. And if Judith's mother half guessed, and if Susanna
Hall shrewdly perceived, why this topic had been introduced,
and why Julius Shawe had been asked to attend
the lecture, the subject was one that brought no sting to
their conscience. If the whole question rested on the
general and implied consent of the husband, Judith's
mother had naught to tax herself with.</p>

<p>After that there was no further remonstrance (of however
gentle and underhand a kind) on the part of Julius
Shawe; and more and more did Parson Blaise become the
guide, instructor, and mainstay of the household. They
were women-folk, some of them timid, all of them pious,
and they experienced a sense of comfort and safety in submitting
to his spiritual domination. As for his disinterestedness,
there could be no doubt of that; for now Judith
was away at Shottery, and he could no longer pay court
to her in that authoritative fashion of his. It seemed as
if he were quite content to be with these others, bringing
them the news of the day, especially as regarded the religious
dissensions that were everywhere abroad, arranging
for the welcoming of this or that faithful teacher on
his way through the country, getting up meetings for
prayer and profitable discourse in the afternoon, or sitting
quietly with them in the evening while they went on with
their tasks of dress-making or embroidery.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Master Walter was in the
house one morning&mdash;they were seated at dinner, indeed,
and Prudence was also of the company&mdash;when a letter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>brought in and handed to Judith's mother. It was an unusual
thing; and all saw by the look of it that it was from
London; and all were eager for the news, the good parson
as well as any. There was not a word said as Judith's
mother, with fingers that trembled a little from mere anticipation,
opened the large sheet, and began to read to
herself across the closely written lines. And then, as they
waited, anxious for the last bit of tidings about the King
or the Parliament or what not, they could not fail to observe
a look of alarm come into the reader's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Susan," she said, in a way that startled them,
"what is this?"</p>

<p>She read on, breathless and stunned, her face grown
quite pale now; and at last she stretched out her shaking
hand with the letter in it.</p>

<p>"Susan, Susan, take it. I cannot understand it. I cannot
read more. Oh, Susan, what has the girl done?"</p>

<p>And she turned aside her chair, and began to cry stealthily;
she was not a strong-nerved woman, and she had
gathered but a vague impression that something terrible
and irrevocable had occurred.</p>

<p>Susan was alarmed, no doubt; but she had plenty of
self-command. She took the letter, and proceeded as
swiftly as she could to get at the contents of it. Then she
looked up in a frightened way at the parson, as if to judge
in her own mind as to how far he should be trusted in this
matter. And then she turned to the letter again&mdash;in a
kind of despair.</p>

<p>"Mother," said she at last, "I understand no more than
yourself what should be done. To think that all this
should have been going on, and we knowing naught of it!
But you see what my father wants; that is the first thing.
Who is to go to Judith?"</p>

<p>At the mere mention of Judith's name a flash of dismay
went to Prudence's heart. She knew that something must
have happened; she at once bethought her of Judith's interviews
with the person in hiding; and she was conscious
of her own guilty connivance and secrecy; so that the
blood rushed to her face, and she sat there dreading to
know what was coming.</p>

<p>"Mother," Susan said again, and rather breathlessly,
"do you not think, in such a pass, we might beg Master
Blaise to give us of his advice? The Doctor being from
home, who else is there?"</p>

<p>"Nay, if I can be of any service to you or yours, good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>Mistress Hall, I pray you have no scruple in commanding
me," said the parson&mdash;with his clear and keen gray eyes
calmly waiting for information.</p>

<p>Judith's mother was understood to give her consent;
and then Susan (after a moment's painful hesitation) took
up the letter.</p>

<p>"Indeed, good sir," said she, with an embarrassment
that she rarely showed, "you will see there is reason for
our perplexity, and&mdash;and I pray you be not too prompt to
think ill of my sister. Perchance there may be explanations,
or the story wrongly reported. In good truth, sir,
my father writes in no such passion of anger as another
might in such a pass, though 'tis but natural he should be
sorely troubled and vexed."</p>

<p>Again she hesitated, being somewhat unnerved and bewildered
by what she had just been reading. She was
trying to recall things, to measure possibilities, to overcome
her amazement, all at once. And then she knew
that the parson was coolly regarding her, and she strove
to collect her wits.</p>

<p>"This, good sir, is the manner of it," said she, in as calm
a way as she could assume, "that my father and his associates
have but recently made a discovery that concerns
them much, and is even a disaster to them; 'tis no less
than that a copy of my father's last written play&mdash;the very
one, indeed, that he finished ere leaving Stratford&mdash;hath
lately been sold, they scarce know by whom as yet, to a
certain bookseller in London, and that the bookseller is
either about to print it and sell it, or threatens to do so.
They all of them, my father says, are grievously annoyed
by this, for that the publishing of the play will satisfy
many who will read it at home instead of coming to the
theatre, and that thus the interests of himself and his associates
will suffer gravely. I am sorry, good sir, to trouble
you with such matters," she added, with a glance of apology,
"but they come more near home to us than you
might think."</p>

<p>"I have offered to you my service in all things&mdash;that
befit my office," said Master Walter, but with a certain reserve,
as if he did not quite like the course that matters
were taking.</p>

<p>"And then," continued Susan, glancing at the writing
before her, "my father says that they were much perplexed
(having no right at law to stop such a publication),
and made inquiries as to how any such copy could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>found its way into the bookseller's hands; whereupon he
discovered that which hath grieved him far more than the
trouble about the play. Prudence, you are her nearest
gossip; it cannot be true!" she exclaimed; and she turned
to the young maiden, whose face was no longer pale and
thoughtful, but rose-colored with shame and alarm. "For
he says 'tis a story that is now everywhere abroad in London&mdash;and
a laugh and a jest at the taverns&mdash;how that one
Jack Orridge came down to Warwickshire, and made believe
to be a wizard, and cozened Judith&mdash;Judith, Prudence,
our Judith!&mdash;heard ye ever the like?&mdash;into a secret
love affair; and that she gave him a copy of the play as
one of her favors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Truly, now, that is false on the face of it," said Master
Blaise, appositely. "That is a tale told by some one who
knows not that Judith hath no skill of writing."</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis too bewildering!" Susan said, as she turned
again to the letter in a kind of despair. "But to have
such a story going about London&mdash;about Judith&mdash;about
my sister Judith&mdash;how can you wonder that my father
should write in haste and in anger? That she should
meet this young man day after day at a farm-house near
to Bidford, and in secret, and listen to his stories of
the court, believing him to be a worthy gentleman in
misfortune! A worthy gentleman truly!&mdash;to come and
make sport of a poor country maiden, and teach her to
deceive her father and all of us, not one of us knowing&mdash;not
one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Susan! Susan!" Prudence cried, in an agony of
grief, "'tis not as you think. 'Tis not as it is written there.
I will confess the truth. I myself knew of the young man
being in the neighborhood, and how he came to be acquainted
with Judith. And she never was at any farm-house
to meet him, that I know well, but&mdash;but he was
alone, and in trouble, he said, and she was sorry for him,
and durst not speak to any one but me. Nay, if there
be aught wrong, 'twas none of her doing, that I know:
as to the copy of the play, I am ignorant; but 'twas none
of her doing. Susan, you think too harshly&mdash;indeed you
do."</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, I think not harshly," said the other, in a
bewildered way. "I but tell the story as I find it."</p>

<p>"'Tis not true, then. On her part, at least, there was
no whit of any secret love affair, as I know right well,"
said Prudence, with a vehemence near to tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>"I but tell thee the story as my father heard it. Poor
wench, whatever wrong she may have done, I have no
word against her," Judith's sister said.</p>

<p>"I pray you continue," interposed Master Blaise, with
his eyes calmly fixed on the letter; he had scarcely uttered
a word.</p>

<p>"Oh, my father goes on to say that this Orridge&mdash;this
person representing himself as familiar with the court,
and the great nobles, and the like&mdash;is none other than the
illegitimate son of an Oxfordshire gentleman who became
over well acquainted with the daughter of an innkeeper
in Oxford town; that the father meant to bring up the lad,
and did give him some smattering of education, but died;
that ever since he hath been dependent on his grandmother,
a widow, who still keeps the inn; and that he hath lived
his life in London in any sort of company he could impose
upon by reason of his fine manners. These particulars,
my father says, he hath had from Ben Jonson, that seems
to know something of the young man, and maintains that
he is not so much vicious or ill-disposed as reckless and
idle, and that he is as likely as not to end his days with a
noose round his neck. This, saith my father, is all that
he can learn, and he would have us question Judith as to
the truth of the story, and as to how the copy of the play
was made, and whether 'twas this same Orridge that carried
it to London. And all this he would have inquired
into at once, for his associates and himself are in great
straits because of this matter, and have urgent need to
know as much as can be known. Then there is this further
writing toward the end&mdash;'I cannot explain all to thee
at this time; but 'tis so that we have no remedy against
the rascal publisher. Even if they do not register at the
Stationers' Company, they but offend the Company; and
the only punishment that might at the best befall them
would be his Grace of Canterbury so far misliking the
play as to cause it to be burnt&mdash;a punishment that would
fall heavier on us, I take it, than on them; and that is in
no case to be anticipated.'"</p>

<p>"I cannot understand these matters, good sir," Judith's
mother said drying her eyes. "'Tis my poor wench that
I think of. I know she meant no harm&mdash;whatever comes
of it. And she is so gentle and so proud-spirited that a
word of rebuke from her father will drive her out of her
reason. That she should have fallen into such trouble,
poor wench! poor wench!&mdash;and you, Prudence, that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>ever her intimate, and seeing her in such a coil&mdash;that you
should not have told us of it!"</p>

<p>Prudence sat silent under this reproach: she knew not
how to defend herself. Perhaps she did not care, for all
her thoughts were about Judith.</p>

<p>"Saw you ever the young man?" Susan said, scarcely
concealing her curiosity.</p>

<p>"Nay, not I," was Prudence's answer. "But your grandmother
hath seen him, and that several times."</p>

<p>"My grandmother!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"For he used to call at the cottage," said Prudence,
"and pass an hour or two&mdash;being in hiding, as he said, and
glad to have a little company. And he greatly pleased
the old dame, as I have heard, because of his gracious
courtesy and good breeding; and when they believed him
to be in sad trouble, and pitied him, who would be the
first to speak and denounce a stranger so helpless? Nay,
I know that I have erred. Had I had more courage I should
have come to you, Susan, and begged you to draw Judith
away from any further communication with the young
man; but I&mdash;I know not how it came about; she hath
such a winning and overpersuading way, and is herself
so fearless."</p>

<p>"A handsome youth, perchance?" said Susan, who
seemed to wish to know more about this escapade of her
sister's.</p>

<p>"Right handsome, as I have heard; and of great courtesy
and gentle manners," Prudence answered. "But well
I know what it was that led Judith to hold communication
with him after she would fain have had that broken off."
And then Prudence, with such detail as was within her
knowledge, explained how Judith had come to think that
the young stranger talked overmuch of Ben Jonson, and was
anxious to show that her father could write as well as he (or
better, as she considered). And then came the story of the
lending of the sheets of the play, and Prudence had to confess
how that she had been Judith's accomplice on many a
former occasion in purloining and studying the treasures
laid by in the summer-house. She told all that she knew
openly and simply and frankly; and if she was in distress,
it was with no thought of herself; it was in thinking of
her dear friend and companion away over there at Shottery,
who was all in ignorance of what was about to befall her.</p>

<p>Then the three women, being somewhat recovered from
their dismay, but still helpless and bewildered, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>not knowing what to do, turned to the parson. He had
sat calm and collected, silent for the most part, and reading
in between the lines of the story his own interpretation.
Perhaps, also, he had been considering other possibilities&mdash;as
to the chances that such an occasion offered
for gathering back to the fold an errant lamb.</p>

<p>"What your father wants done, that is the first thing,
sweetheart," Judith's mother said, in a tremulous and
dazed kind of fashion. "As to the poor wench, we will
see about her afterward. And not a harsh word will I send
her; she will have punishment enough to bear&mdash;poor lass!
poor lass! So heedless and so headstrong she hath been
always, but always the quickest to suffer if a word were
spoken to her; and now if this story be put about, how
will she hold up her head&mdash;she that was so proud? But
what your father wants done, Susan, that is the first thing&mdash;that
is the first thing. See what you can do to answer
the letter as he wishes: you are quicker to understand
such things than I."</p>

<p>And then the parson spoke, in his clear, incisive, and
authoritative way:</p>

<p>"Good madam, 'tis little I know of these matters in
London; but if you would have Judith questioned&mdash;and
that might be somewhat painful to any one of her relatives&mdash;I
will go and see her for you, if you think fit. If
she have been the victim of knavish designs, 'twill be easy
for her to acquit herself; carelessness, perchance, may be
the only charge to be brought against her. And as I
gather from Prudence that the sheets of manuscript lent
to the young man were in his possession for a certain
time, I make no doubt that the copy&mdash;if it came from this
neighborhood at all&mdash;was made by himself on those occasions,
and that she had no hand in the mischief, save in
overtrusting a stranger. Doubtless your husband, good
madam, is desirous of having clear and accurate statements
on these and other points; whereas, if you, or Mistress
Hall, or even Prudence there, were to go and see
Judith, natural affection and sympathy might blunt the
edge of your inquiries. You would be so anxious to excuse
(and who would not, in your place?) that the very
information asked for by your husband would be lost
sight of. Therefore I am willing to do as you think fitting.
I may not say that my office lends any special
sanction to such a duty, for this is but a worldly matter;
but friendship hath its obligations: and if I can be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>service to you, good Mistress Shakespeare, 'tis far from
repaying what I owe of godly society and companionship
to you and yours. These be rather affairs for men to deal
with than for women, who know less of the ways of the
world; and I take it that Judith, when she is made aware
of her father's wishes, will have no hesitation in meeting
me with frankness and sincerity."</p>

<p>It was this faculty of his of speaking clearly and well
and to the point that in a large measure gave him such
an ascendency over those women; he seemed always to
see a straight path before him; to have confidence in himself,
and a courage to lead the way.</p>

<p>"Good sir, if you would have so much kindness," Judith's
mother said. "Truly, you offer us help and guidance in
a dire necessity. And if you will tell her what it is her
father wishes to know, be sure that will be enough; the
wench will answer you, have no fear, good sir."</p>

<p>Then Susan said, when he was about to go:</p>

<p>"Worthy sir, you need not say to her all that you have
heard concerning the young man. I would liefer know
what she herself thought of him; and how they came
together; and how he grew to be on such friendly terms
with her. For hitherto she hath been so sparing of her
favor; though many have wished her to change her name
for theirs; but always the wench hath kept roving eyes.
Handsome was he, Prudence? And of gentle manners,
said you? Nay, I warrant me 'twas something far from
the common that led Judith such a dance."</p>

<p>But Prudence, when he was leaving, stole out after him;
and when he was at the door, she put her hand on his
arm. He turned, and saw that the tears were running
down her face.</p>

<p>"Be kind to Judith," she said&mdash;not heeding that he saw
her tears, and still clinging to his arm; "be kind to Judith,
from my heart I beg it of you&mdash;I pray you be kind and
gentle with her, good Master Blaise; for indeed she is like
an own sister to me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></h2>

<h3>RENEWALS.</h3>

<p>As yet she was all unconscious; and indeed the dulness
following her father's departure was for her considerably
lightened by this visit to her grandmother's cottage,
where she found a hundred duties and occupations awaiting
her. She was an expert needle-woman, and there
were many arrears in that direction to be made up: she
managed the cooking, and introduced one or two cunning
dishes, to the wonder of the little Cicely; she even tried
her hand at carpentering, where a shelf, or the frame of a
casement, had got loose; and as a reward she was occasionally
invited to assist her grandmother in the garden.
The old dame herself grew wonderfully amiable and cheerful
in the constant association with this bright young life;
and she had a great store of ballads with which to beguile
the tedium of sewing&mdash;though, in truth, these were for
the most part of a monotonous and mournful character,
generally reciting the woes of some poor maiden in Oxfordshire
or Lincolnshire who had been deceived by a
false lover, and yet was willing to forgive him even as she
lay on her death-bed. As for Judith, she took to this
quiet life quite naturally and happily; and if she chanced
to have time for a stroll along the wooded lanes or
through the meadows, she was now right glad that there
was no longer any fear of her being confronted by Master
Leofric Hope&mdash;or Jack Orridge, as he had called himself.
Of course she thought of him often, and of his courteous
manners, and his eloquent and yet modest eyes, and she
hoped all was going well with him, and that she might perchance
hear of him through her father. Nor could she forget
(for she was but human) that the young man, when disguised
as a wizard, had said that he had heard her named as
the fairest maid in Warwickshire; and subsequently, in his
natural character, that he had heard Ben Jonson speak
well of her looks, and she hoped that if ever he recalled
these brief interviews, he would consider that she had
maintained a sufficiency of maidenly dignity, and had not
betrayed the ignorance or awkwardness of a farm-bred
wench. Nay, there were certain words of his that she put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>some store by&mdash;as coming from a stranger. For the rest,
she was in no case likely to undervalue her appearance:
her father had praised her hair, and that was enough.</p>

<p>One morning she had gone down to the little front gate,
for some mischievous boys had lifted it off its hinges, and
she wanted to get it back again on the rusty iron spikes.
But it had got jammed somehow, and would not move;
and in her pulling, some splinter of the wood ran into her
hand, causing not a little pain. Just at this moment&mdash;whether
he had come round that way on the chance of
catching a glimpse of her, it is hard to say&mdash;Tom Quiney
came by; but on the other side of the road, and clearly
with no intention of calling at the cottage.</p>

<p>"Good-morrow, Judith," said he, in a kind of uncertain
way, and would have gone on.</p>

<p>Well, she was vexed and impatient with her fruitless
efforts, and her hand smarted not a little; so she looked
at him and said, half angrily,</p>

<p>"I wish you would come and lift this gate."</p>

<p>It was but a trifling task for the tall and straight-limbed
young fellow who now strode across the highway. He
jerked it up in a second, and then set it down again on the
iron spikes, where it swung in its wonted way.</p>

<p>"But your hand is bleeding, Judith!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"'Tis nothing," she said. "It was a splinter. I have
pulled it out."</p>

<p>But he snatched her hand peremptorily, before she
could draw it away, and held it firmly and examined it.</p>

<p>"Why, there's a bit still there; I can see it."</p>

<p>"I can get it out for myself," said she.</p>

<p>"No, you cannot," he answered. "'Tis far easier for
some one else. Stay here a second, and I will fetch out a
needle."</p>

<p>He went into the cottage, and presently reappeared,
not only with a needle, but also a tin vessel holding water,
and a bit of linen and a piece of thread. Then he took
Judith's soft hand as gently as he could in his muscular
fingers, and began to probe for the small fragment of
wood, just visible there. He seemed a long time about it;
perhaps he was afraid of giving her pain.</p>

<p>"Do I hurt you, Judith?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, with some color of embarrassment
in her face. "Be quick."</p>

<p>"But I must be cautious," said he. "I would it were
my own hand; I would make short work of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>"Let me try myself," said she, attempting to get away
her hand from his grasp.</p>

<p>But he would not allow that; and in due time he managed
to get the splinter out. Then he dipped his fingers
in the water and bathed the small wound in that way; and
then he must needs wrap the piece of linen round her hand&mdash;very
carefully, so that there should be no crease&mdash;and
thereafter fasten the bandage with the bit of thread. He
did not look like one who could perform a surgical operation
with exceeding delicacy; but he was as gentle as he
could be, and she thanked him&mdash;in an unwilling kind of
way.</p>

<p>Then all at once her face brightened.</p>

<p>"Why," said she, "I hear that you gave my father a
riding-whip on his going."</p>

<p>"Did you not see it, Judith?" he said, with some disappointment.
"I meant you to have seen it. The handle
was of ivory, and of a rare carving."</p>

<p>"I was not at the door when they went away&mdash;I met
my father as they passed along the road," said she. "But
I shall see it, doubtless, when he comes home again. And
what said he? Was he pleased? He thanked you right
heartily, did he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly; but 'twas a trifling matter."</p>

<p>"My father thinks more of the intention than of the
value of such a gift," said she&mdash;"as I would."</p>

<p>It was an innocent and careless speech, but it seemed to
suddenly inspire him with a kind of wild wish.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, regarding her, "if you, Judith, now,
would but take some little gift from me&mdash;no matter what&mdash;that
would be a day I should remember all my life."</p>

<p>"Will you not come into the house?" said she, quickly.
"My grandam will be right glad to see you."</p>

<p>She would have led the way; but he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Nay, I will not trouble your grandmother, Judith,"
said he. "I doubt not but that she hath had enough of
visitors since you came to stay with her."</p>

<p>"Since I came?" she said, good-naturedly&mdash;for she refused
to accept the innuendo. "Why, let me consider,
now. The day before yesterday my mother walked over
to see how we did; and before that&mdash;I think the day before
that&mdash;Mistress Wyse came in to tell us that they had
taken a witch at Abbots Morton; and then yesterday Farmer
Bowstead called to ask if his strayed horse had been
seen anywhere about these lanes. There, now, three visitors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>since I have come to the cottage: 'tis not a multitude."</p>

<p>"There hath been none other?" said he, looking at her
with some surprise.</p>

<p>"Not another foot hath crossed the threshold to my
knowledge," said she, simply, and as if it were a matter of
small concern.</p>

<p>But this intelligence seemed to produce a very sudden
and marked alteration in his manner. Not only would he
accompany her into the house, but he immediately became
most solicitous about her hand.</p>

<p>"I pray you be careful, Judith," said he, almost as if
he would again take hold of her wrist.</p>

<p>"'Tis but a scratch," she said.</p>

<p>"Nay, now, if there be but a touch of rust, it might
work mischief," said he, anxiously. "I pray you be careful;
and I would bathe it frequently, and keep on the
bandage until you are sure that all is well. Nay, I tell
you this, Judith: there are more than you think of that
would liefer lose a finger than that you should have the
smallest hurt."</p>

<p>And in-doors, moreover, he was most amiable and gentle
and anxious to please, and bore some rather sharp sayings
of the old dame with great good-nature; and whatever
Judith said, or suggested, or approved of, that was
right, once and for all. She wished to hear more of the
riding-whip also. Where was the handle carved? Had
her father expressed any desire for such ornamentation?</p>

<p>"Truly 'twas but a small return for his kindness to us
the other day," said the young man, who was half bewildered
with delight at finding Judith's eyes once more regarding
him in the old frank and friendly fashion, and
was desperately anxious that they should continue so to
regard him (with no chilling shadow of the parson intervening).
"For Cornelius Greene being minded to make
one or two more catches," he continued&mdash;and still addressing
those eyes that were at once so gentle and so clear and
so kind&mdash;"he would have me go to your father and beg
him to give us words for these, out of any books he might
know of. Not that we thought of asking him to write the
words himself&mdash;far from that&mdash;but to choose them for us;
and right willingly he did so. In truth, I have them with
me," he added, searching for and producing a paper with
some written lines on it. "Shall I read them to you,
Judith?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p><p>He did not notice the slight touch of indifference with
which she assented; for when once she had heard that
these compositions (whatever they might be) were not her
father's writing, she was not anxious to become acquainted
with them. But his concern, on the other hand, was to
keep her interested and amused and friendly; and Cornelius
Greene and his doings were at least something to talk
about.</p>

<p>"The first one we think of calling 'Fortune's Wheel,'"
said he; "and thus it goes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Trust not too much, if prosperous times do smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor yet despair of rising, if thou fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fatal Lady mingleth one with th' other,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And lets not fortune stay, but round turns all.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">And the other one&mdash;I know not how to call it yet&mdash;but
Cornelius takes it to be the better of the two for his purpose;
thus it is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Merrily sang the Ely monks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When rowed thereby Canute the King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Row near, my Knights, row near the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That we may hear the good monks sing."'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">See you now how well it will go, Judith&mdash;<i>Merrily sang&mdash;merrily
sang&mdash;the Ely monks&mdash;the Ely monks&mdash;when rowed
thereby</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Canute the King</span>!" said he, in a manner suggesting
the air. "'Twill go excellent well for four voices,
and Cornelius is already begun. In truth, 'twill be something
new at our merry-meetings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, and what have you to say of your business, good
Master Quiney?" the old dame interrupted, sharply. "Be
you so busy with your tavern catches and your merry-makings
that you have no thought of that?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have enough regard for that, good Mistress
Hathaway," said he, in perfect good-humor; "and it goes
forward safely enough. But methinks you remind me
that I have tarried here as long as I ought; so now I will
get me back to the town."</p>

<p>He half expected that Judith would go to the door with
him; and when she had gone so far, he said,</p>

<p>"Will you not come a brief way across the meadows,
Judith?&mdash;'tis not well you should always be shut up in the
cottage&mdash;you that are so fond of out-of-doors."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p><p>He had no cause for believing that she was too much
within-doors; but she did not stay to raise the question;
she good-naturedly went down the little garden path with
him, and across the road, and so into the fields. She had
been busy at work all the morning; twenty minutes' idleness
would do no harm.</p>

<p>Then, when they were quite by themselves, he said
seriously:</p>

<p>"I pray you take heed, Judith, that you let not the blood
flow too much to your hand, lest it inflame the wound, however
slight you may deem it. See, now, if you would but
hold it so, 'twould rest on mine, and be a relief to you."</p>

<p>He did not ask her to take his arm, but merely that she
should rest her hand on his; and this seemed easy to do,
and natural (so long as he was not tired). But also it
seemed very much like the time when they used to go
through those very meadows as boy and girl together, the
tips of their fingers intertwined: and so she spoke in a gentle
and friendly kind of fashion to him.</p>

<p>"And how is it with your business, in good sooth?" she
asked. "I hope there be no more of these junketings, and
dancings, and brawls."</p>

<p>"Dear Judith," said he, "I know not who carries such
tales of me to you. If you knew but the truth, I am never
in a brawl of mine own making or seeking; but one must
hold one's own, and the more that is done, the less are any
likely to interfere. Nay," he continued, with a modest
laugh, "I think I am safe for quiet now with any in Warwickshire;
'tis only a strange lad now and again that may
come among us and seek cause of quarrel; and surely 'tis
better to have it over and done with, and either he or we
to know our place? I seek no fighting for the love of it;
my life on that; but you would not have any stranger
come into Stratford a-swaggering, and biting his thumb at
us, and calling us rogues of fiddlers?"</p>

<p>"Mercy on us, then," she cried, "are you champion for
the town&mdash;or perchance for all of Warwickshire? A goodly
life to look forward to! And what give they their watch-dog?
Truly they must reward him that keeps such guard,
and will do battle for them all?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I am none such, Judith," said he; "I but take my
chance like the others."</p>

<p>He shifted her hand on his, that it might rest the more
securely, and his touch was gentle.</p>

<p>"And your merchandise&mdash;pray you, who is so kind as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>look after that when you are engaged in those pastimes?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I have no fault to find with my merchandise, Judith,"
said he. "That I look after myself. I would I had more
inducement to attend to it, and to provide for the future.
But it goes well; indeed it does."</p>

<p>"And Daniel Hutt?"</p>

<p>"He has left the country now."</p>

<p>"And his vagabond crew&mdash;have they all made their fortunes?"</p>

<p>"Why, Judith, they cannot have reached America yet,"
said he.</p>

<p>"I am glad that you have not gone," she remarked,
simply.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "why should I strive to push my fortunes
there more than here? To what end? There be
none that I could serve either way."</p>

<p>And then it seemed to him that it was an ungracious
speech; and he was anxious to stand well with her, seeing
that she was disposed to be friendly.</p>

<p>"Judith," he said, suddenly, "surely you will not remain
over at Shottery to-morrow, with all the merriment of the
fair going on in the town? Nay, but you must come over&mdash;I
could fetch you, at any hour that you named, if it so
pleased you. There is a famous juggler come into the
town, as I hear, that can do the most rare and wonderful
tricks, and hath a dog as cunning as himself; and you will
hear the new ballads, to judge which you would have; and
the peddlers would show you their stores. Now, in good
sooth, Judith, may not I come for you? Why, all the
others have someone to go about with them; and she will
choose this or that posy or ribbon, and wear it for the jest
of the day; but I have no one to walk through the crowd
with me, and see the people, and hear the bargainings and
the music. I pray you, Judith, let me come for you. It
cannot be well for you always to live in such dulness as
is over there at Shottery."</p>

<p>"If I were to go to the fair with you," said she, and not
unkindly, "methinks the people would stare, would they
not? We have not been such intimate friends of late."</p>

<p>"You asked me not to go to America, Judith," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," she admitted. "Truly I did so. Why
should you go away with those desperate and broken men?
Surely 'tis better you should stay among your own people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>"I stayed because you bade me, Judith," said he.</p>

<p>She flushed somewhat at this; but he was so eager not
to embarrass or offend her that he instantly changed the
subject.</p>

<p>"May I, then, Judith? If you would come but for an
hour!" he pleaded, for he clearly wanted to show to everybody
that Judith was under his escort at the fair; and
which of all the maidens (he asked himself) would compare
beside her? "Why, there is not one of them but
hath his companion, to buy for her some brooch, or pretty
coif, or the like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are they all so anxious to lighten their purses?" said
she, laughing. "Nay, but truly I may not leave my
grandmother, lest the good dame should think that I was
wearying of my stay with her. Pray you, get some other
to go to the fair with you&mdash;you have many friends, as I
know, in the town&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think 'tis the fair I care about?" said he,
quickly. "Nay, now, Judith, I would as lief not go to the
fair at all&mdash;or but for a few minutes&mdash;if you will let me
bring you over some trinket in the afternoon. Nay, a
hundred times would I rather not go&mdash;if you would grant
me such a favor; 'tis the first I have asked of you for
many a day."</p>

<p>"Why," she said, with a smile, "you must all of you
be prospering in Stratford, since you are all so eager to
cast abroad your money. The peddlers will do a rare
trade to-morrow, as I reckon."</p>

<p>This was almost a tacit permission, and he was no such
fool as to press her for more. Already his mind ran riot&mdash;he
saw himself ransacking all the packs and stalls in the
town.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, as she had come within sight of
the houses, "I will return now or the good dame will
wonder."</p>

<p>"But I will walk back with you, Judith," said he,
promptly.</p>

<p>She regarded him, with those pretty eyes of hers clearly
laughing.</p>

<p>"Methought you came away from the cottage," said she,
"because of the claims of your business; and now you
would walk all the way back again?"</p>

<p>"Your hand, Judith," said he, shamefacedly, "you must
not let it hang down by your side."</p>

<p>"Nay, for such a dangerous wound," said she, with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>eyes gravely regarding him, "I will take precautions; but
cannot I hold it up myself&mdash;so&mdash;if need were?"</p>

<p>He was so well satisfied with what he had gained that
he would yield to her now as she wished. And yet he took
her hand once more, gently and timidly, as if unwilling to
give up his charge of it.</p>

<p>"I hope it will not pain you, Judith," he said.</p>

<p>"I trust it may not lead me to death's door," she answered,
seriously; and if her eyes were laughing, it was
with no unkindness.</p>

<p>And then they said good-bye to each other, and she
walked away back to Shottery, well content to have made
friends with him again, and to have found him for the time
being quit of his dark suspicions and jealousies of her;
while as for him, he went on to the town in a sort of foreknowledge
that all Stratford Fair would not have anything
worthy to be offered to Judith; and wondering whether
he could not elsewhere, and at once, and by any desperate
effort, procure something fine and rare and beautiful
enough to be placed in that poor wounded hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>"THE ROSE IS FROM MY GARDEN GONE."</h3>

<p>Now when Parson Blaise set forth upon the mission that
had been intrusted to him, there was not a trace of anger
or indignation in his mind. He was not even moved by
jealous wrath against the person with whom Judith had
been holding these clandestine communications, nor had
he any sense of having been himself injured by her conduct.
For one thing, he knew enough of Judith's pride
and self-reliance to be fairly well satisfied that she was not
likely to have compromised herself in any serious way;
and for another, his own choice of her, from among the
Stratford maidens, as the one he wished to secure for helpmate,
was the result not so much of any overmastering
passion as of a cool and discriminating judgment. Nay,
this very complication that had arisen, might he not use it
to his own advantage? Might it not prove an argument
more powerful than any he had hitherto tried? And so it
was that he set out, not as one armed to punish, but with
the most placable intentions; and the better to give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>subject full consideration, he did not go straight across
the meadows to the cottage, but went through the town,
and away out the Alcester road, before turning round and
making for Shottery.</p>

<p>Nor did it occur to him that he was approaching this
matter with any mean or selfish ends in view. Far from
that. The man was quite honest. In winning Judith
over to be his wife, by any means whatever, was he not
adding one more to the number of the Lord's people?
Was he not saving her from her own undisciplined and
wayward impulses, and from all the mischief that might
arise from these? What was for his good was for her
good, and the good of the Church also. She had a winning
way; she was friends with many who rather kept
aloof from the more austere of their neighbors; she
would be a useful go-between. Her cheerfulness, her
good temper, nay, her comely presence and bright ways&mdash;all
these would be profitably employed. Nor did he forget
the probability of a handsome marriage-portion, and
the added domestic comfort and serenity that that would
bring himself. Even the marriage-portion (which he had
no doubt would be a substantial one) might be regarded
as coming into the Church in a way; and so all would work
together for good.</p>

<p>When he reached the cottage he found the old dame in
the garden, busy with her flowers and vegetables, and was
told that Judith had just gone within-doors. Indeed, she
had but that minute come back from her stroll across the
fields with Quiney, and had gone in to fetch a jug, so that
she might have some fresh water from the well in the garden.
He met her on the threshold.</p>

<p>"I would say a few words with you, Judith&mdash;and in private,"
said he.</p>

<p>She seemed surprised, but was in no ill-humor, so she
said, "As you will, good sir," and led the way into the
main apartment, where she remained standing.</p>

<p>"I pray you be seated," said he.</p>

<p>She was still more surprised; but she obeyed him, taking
her seat under the window, so that her face was in
shadow, while the light from the small panes fell full on
him sitting opposite her.</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, "I am come upon a serious errand,
and yet would not alarm you unnecessarily. Nay, I think
that when all is done, good may spring out of the present
troubles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>"What is it?" she said quickly. "Is any one ill? my
mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Judith," he said; "'tis no trial of that kind you
are called to face. The Lord hath been merciful to you
and yours these several years; while others have borne
the heavy hand of affliction and lost their dearest at untimeous
seasons, you have been spared for many years
now, all but such trials as come in the natural course:
would I could see you as thankful as you ought to be to
the Giver of all good. And yet I know not but that grief
over such afflictions is easier to bear than grief over the
consequences of our own wrong-doing; memory preserves
this last the longer; sorrow is not so enduring, nor cuts
so deep, as remorse. And then to think that others have
been made to suffer through our evil-doing&mdash;that is an
added sting; when those who have expected naught but
filial obedience and duty&mdash;and the confidence that should
exist between children and their parents&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But this phrase about filial obedience had struck her
with a sudden fear.</p>

<p>"I pray you, what is it, sir? What have I done?" she
said, almost in a cry.</p>

<p>Then he saw that he had gone too fast and too far.</p>

<p>"Nay, Judith," he said, "be not over-alarmed. 'Tis perchance
but carelessness, and a disposition to trust yourself
in all circumstances to your own guidance that have
to be laid to your charge. I hope it may be so; I hope
matters may be no worse; 'tis for yourself to say. I come
from your mother and sister, Judith," he continued, in
measured tones. "I may tell you at once that they have
learned of your having been in secret communication with
a stranger who has been in these parts, and they would
know the truth. I will not seek to judge you beforehand,
nor point out to you what perils and mischances must ever
befall you, so long as you are bent on going your own
way, without government or counsel; that you must now
perceive for yourself&mdash;and I trust the lesson will not be
brought home to you too grievously."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" Judith had said quickly to herself, and
with much relief.</p>

<p>"Good sir," she said to him, coolly, "I hope my good
mother and Susan are in no bewilderment of terror. 'Tis
true, indeed, that there was one in this neighborhood whom
I met and spoke with on several occasions; if there was
secrecy, 'twas because the poor young gentleman was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>hiding; he dared not even present the letter that he
brought commending him to my father. Nay, good Master
Blaise, I pray you comfort my mother and sister, and
assure them there was no harm thought of by the poor
young man."</p>

<p>"I know not that, Judith," said he, with his clear, observant
eyes trying to read her face in the dusk. "But your
mother and sister would fain know what manner of man
he was, and what you know of him, and how he came to
be here."</p>

<p>Then the fancy flashed across her mind that this intervention
of his was but the prompting of his own jealousy,
and that he was acting as the spokesman of her mother
and sister chiefly to get information for himself.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said she, lightly, "I think you might as
well ask these questions of my grandmother, that knoweth
about as much as I do concerning the young man, and was
as sorry as I for his ill fortunes."</p>

<p>"I pray you take not this matter so heedlessly, Judith,"
he said, with some coldness. "'Tis of greater moment
than you think. No idle curiosity has brought me hither
to-day; nay, it is with the authority of your family that I
put these questions to you, and I am charged to ask you to
answer them with all of such knowledge as you may have."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said she, good-naturedly; "his name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was about to say that his name was Leofric Hope,
but she checked herself, and some color rose to her face&mdash;though
he could not see that.</p>

<p>"His name, good sir, as I believe, is John Orridge,"
she continued, but with no embarrassment; indeed she did
not think that she had anything very serious either to conceal
or to confess; "and I fear me the young man is
grievously in debt, or otherwise forced to keep away from
those that would imprison him; and being come to Warwickshire
he brought a letter to my father, but was afraid
to present it. He hath been to the cottage here certain
times, for my grandmother, as well as I, was pleased to
hear of the doings in London; and right civil he was, and
well-mannered; and 'twas news to us to hear about the
theatres, and my father's way of living there. But why
should my mother and Susan seek to know aught of him?
Surely Prudence hath not betrayed the trust I put in her&mdash;for
indeed the young man was anxious that his being in
the neighborhood should not be known to any in Stratford.
However, as he is now gone away, and that some weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>ago, 'tis of little moment, as I reckon; and if ever he
cometh back here, I doubt not but that he will present
himself at New Place, that they may judge of him as they
please. That he can speak for himself, and to advantage
and goodly showing, I know right well."</p>

<p>"And that is all you can say of this man, Judith," said he,
with some severity in his tone&mdash;"with this man that you
have been thus familiar with?"</p>

<p>"Marry is it!" she said, lightly. "But I have had
guesses, no doubt; for first I thought him a gentleman of
the Court, he being apparently acquainted with all the
doings there; and then methought he was nearer to the
theatres, from his knowledge of the players. But you
would not have had me ask the young man as to his occupation
and standing, good sir? 'Twould have been unseemly
in a stranger, would it not? Could I dare venture
on questions, he being all unknown to any of us?"</p>

<p>And now a suspicion flashed upon him that she was
merely befooling him, so he came at once and sharply to
the point.</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, endeavoring to pierce with his keen
eyes the dusk that enshrouded her, "you have not told me
all. How came he to have a play of your father's in his
possession?"</p>

<p>"Now," said she, with a quick anger, "that is ill done of
Prudence! No one but Prudence knew; and for so harmless
a secret&mdash;and that all over and gone, moreover&mdash;and
the young man himself away, I know not where&mdash;nay, by
my life! I had not thought that Prudence would serve
me so. And to what end? Why, good sir, I myself lent
the young man the sheets of my father's writing&mdash;they
were the sheets that were thrown aside&mdash;and I got each
and all of them safely back, and replaced them. Prudence
knew what led me to lend him my father's play; and where
was the harm of it? I thought not that she would go and
make trouble out of so small a thing."</p>

<p>By this time the good parson had come to see pretty
clearly how matters stood&mdash;what with Prudence's explanations
and Judith's present confessions; and he made no
doubt that this stranger&mdash;whether from idleness, or for
amusement, or with some more sinister purpose, he had
no means of knowing&mdash;had copied the play when he had
taken the sheets home with him to the farm; while as to
the appearance in London of the copy so taken, it was
sufficiently obvious that Judith was in complete ignorance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>and could afford no information whatever. So that now
the first part of his mission was accomplished. He asked
her a few more questions, and easily discovered that she
knew nothing whatever about the young man's position in
life, or whether he had gone straight from the farm to
London, or whether he was in London now. As to his
being in possession, or having been in possession, of a
copy of her father's play, it was abundantly evident that
she had never dreamed of any such thing.</p>

<p>And now he came to the more personal part of his mission,
that was for him much more serious.</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, "'tis not like you should know what
sad and grievous consequences may spring from errors
apparently small. How should you? You will take no
heed or caution. The advice of those who would be nearest
and dearest to you is of no account with you. You will
go your own way&mdash;as if one of your years and experience
could know the pitfalls that lie in a young maiden's path.
The whole of life is but a jest to you&mdash;a tale without meaning&mdash;something
to pass the hour withal. And think you
that such blindness and wilfulness bring no penalty? Nay,
sooner or later the hour strikes; you look back and see
what you have done&mdash;and the offers of safe guidance that
you have neglected or thrust aside."</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir, what is it now?" she said, indifferently
(and with a distinct wish that he would go away and release
her, and let her get out into the light again). "Methought
I had filled up the measure of my iniquities."</p>

<p>"Thus it is&mdash;thus it will be always," said he, with a kind
of hopelessness, "so long as you harden your heart and
have no thought but for the vanities of the moment."
And then he addressed her more pointedly. "But even
now methinks I can tell you what will startle you out of
your moral sloth, which is an offence in the eyes of the
Lord, as it is a cause for pity and almost despair to all who
know you. It was a light matter, you think, that you
should hold this secret commerce with a stranger; careless
of the respect due to your father's house; careless of the
opinion and the anxious wishes of your friends; careless,
even, of your good name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My good name?" said she, quickly and sharply. "I
pray you, sir, have heed what you say."</p>

<p>"Have heed to what I have to tell you, Judith," said he,
sternly. "Ay, and take warning by it. Think you that I
have pleasure in being the bearer of evil tidings?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>"But what now, sir? What now? Heaven's mercy on
us, let us get to the end of the dreadful deeds I have
done!" she exclaimed, with some anger and impatience.</p>

<p>"I would spare you, but may not," said he, calmly.
"And, now, what if I were to tell you that this young
man whom you encouraged into secret conversation&mdash;whose
manners seemed to have had so much charm for
you&mdash;was a rascal, thief, and villain? How would your
pride bear it if I told you that he had cozened you with
some foolish semblance of a wizard?"</p>

<p>"Good sir, I know it," she retorted. "He himself told
me as much."</p>

<p>"Perchance. Perchance 'twas part of his courteous
manners to tell you as much!" was the scornful rejoinder.
"But he did not tell you all&mdash;he did not tell you that he
had copied out every one of those sheets of your father's
writing; that he was about to carry that stolen copy to
London, like the knave and thief that he was; that he
was to offer it for money to the booksellers. He did not
tell you that soon your father and his associates in the
theatre would be astounded by learning that a copy of the
new play had been obtained, in some dark fashion, and
sold; that it was out of their power to recover it; that
their interests would be seriously affected by this vile conspiracy;
or that they would by and by discover that this
purloined play, which was like to cause them so much
grievous loss and vexation of mind, had been obtained
here&mdash;in this very neighborhood&mdash;and by the aid of no
other than your father's daughter."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;told&mdash;you&mdash;this?" she asked in a strange,
stunned way: her eyes were terror-stricken, her hands all
trembling.</p>

<p>"A good authority," said he&mdash;"your father. A letter is
but now come from London."</p>

<p>She uttered a low, shuddering cry; it was a moan almost.</p>

<p>"See you now," said he (for he knew that all her
bravery was struck down, and she entirely at his mercy),
"what must ever come of your wilfulness and your scorn
of those who would aid and guide you? Loving counsel
and protection are offered you&mdash;the natural shield of a
woman; but you must needs go your own way alone.
And to what ends? Think you that this is all? Not so.
For the woman who makes to herself her own rule of conduct
must be prepared for calumnious tongues. And bethink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>you what your father must have thought of you&mdash;the
only daughter of his household now&mdash;when he learned
the story of this young man coming into Warwickshire,
and befooling you with his wizard's tricks, and meeting
you secretly, and cozening you of the sheets of your
father's play. These deeds that are done in the dark soon
reach to daylight; and can you wonder, when your father
found your name abroad in London&mdash;the heroine of a
common jest&mdash;a byword&mdash;that his vexation and anger
should overmaster him? What marvel that he should
forthwith send to Stratford, demanding to know what
further could be learned of the matter&mdash;perchance fondly
trusting, who knows, to find that rumor had lied? But
there is no such hope for him&mdash;nor for you. What must
your mother say in reply? What excuse can she offer?
Or how make reparation to those associates of your father
who suffer with him? And how get back your good
name, that is being bandied about the town as the heroine
of a foolish jest? Your father may regain possession of
his property&mdash;I know not whether that be possible or no&mdash;but
can he withdraw the name of his daughter from the
ribald wit of the taverns? And I know which he valueth
the more highly, if his own daughter know it not."</p>

<p>He had struck hard; he knew not how hard.</p>

<p>"My father wrote thus?" she said; and her head was
bent, and her hands covering her face.</p>

<p>"I read the letter no more than an hour ago," said he.
"Your mother and sister would have me come over to
see whether such a story could be true; but Prudence had
already admitted as much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And my father is angered?" she said, in that low,
strange voice.</p>

<p>"Can you wonder at it?" he said.</p>

<p>Again there came an almost inarticulate moan, like that
of an animal stricken to death.</p>

<p>As for him, he had now the opportunity of pouring forth
the discourse to her that he had in a measure prepared as
he came along the highway. He knew right well that she
would be sorely wounded by this terrible disclosure; that
the proud spirit would be in the dust; that she would be in
a very bewilderment of grief. And he thought that now
she might consent to gentle leading, and would trust herself
to the only one (himself, to wit) capable of guiding
her through her sorrows; and he had many texts and illustrations
apposite. She heard not one word. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>as motionless as one dead; and the vision that rose before
her burning brain was the face of her father as she
had seen it for a moment in the garden, on the morning
of his departure. That terrible swift look of anger toward
old Matthew she had never forgotten&mdash;the sudden
lowering of the brows, the flash in the eyes, the strange
contraction of the mouth; and that was what she saw
now&mdash;that was how he was regarding her&mdash;and that, she
knew, would be the look that would meet her always and
always as she lay and thought of him in the long, wakeful
nights. She could not go to him. London was far away.
She could not go to him and throw herself at his feet, and
beg and pray with outstretched and trembling hands for
but one word of pity. The good parson had struck hard.</p>

<p>And yet in a kind of way he was trying to administer
consolation&mdash;at all events, counsel. He was enlarging on
the efficacy of prayer. And he said that if the Canaanitish
woman of old had power to intercede for her daughter,
and win succor for her, surely that would not be denied
to such an one as Judith's mother, if she sought, for her
daughter, strength and fortitude in trouble where alone
these could be found.</p>

<p>"The Canaanitish woman," said he, "had but the one
saving grace, but that an all-powerful one, of faith; and
even when the disciples would have her sent away, she
followed worshipping, and saying 'Lord, help me.' And
the Lord himself answered and said, 'It is not good to
take the children's bread, and to cast it to whelps.' But
she said, 'Truth, Lord; yet indeed the whelps eat of the
crumbs which fall from their master's table.' Then our
Lord answered, and said, 'O woman, great is thy faith;
be it to thee as thou desirest.' And her daughter was
made whole at that hour."</p>

<p>Judith started up; she had not heard a single word.</p>

<p>"I pray you, pardon me, good sir," she said, for she
was in a half-frantic state of misery and despair; "my&mdash;my
grandmother will speak with you&mdash;I&mdash;I pray you
pardon me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She got up into her own little chamber&mdash;she scarce
knew how. She sat down on the bed. There were no
tears in her eyes, but there was a terrible weight on her
chest that seemed to stifle her; and she was breathless,
and could not think aright, and her trembling hands were
clinched. Sometimes she wildly thought she wanted
Prudence to come to her; and then a kind of shudder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>possessed her&mdash;and a wish to go away&mdash;she cared not
where&mdash;and be seen no more. That crushing weight increased,
choking her; she could not rest; she rose, and
went quickly down the stair, and through the garden into
the road.</p>

<p>"Judith, wench!" called her grandmother, who was
talking to the parson.</p>

<p>She took no heed. She went blindly on; and all these
familiar things seemed so different now. How could the
children laugh so? She got into the Bidford road; she
did not turn her eyes toward any whom she met, to see
whether she knew them or no&mdash;there was enough within
her own brain for her to think of. She made her way to
the summit of Bardon Hill, and there she looked over the
wide landscape; but it was toward London that she looked,
and with a strange and trembling fear. And then she
seemed anxious to hide away from being seen, and went
down by hedge-rows and field-paths, and at last she was
by the river. She regarded it, flowing so stealthily by, in
the sad and monotonous silence. Here was an easy means
of slipping away from all this dread thing that seemed to
surround her and overwhelm her&mdash;to glide away as noiselessly
and peacefully as the river itself to any unknown
shore, she cared not what. And then she sat down, still
looking vaguely and absently at the water, and began to
think of all that had happened to her on the banks of this
stream; and she looked at these visionary pictures and at
herself in them as if they were apart and separated from
her, and she never to be like that again. Was it possible
that she ever could have been so careless and so happy,
with no weight at all resting on her heart, but singing out
of mere thoughtlessness, and teaching Willie Hart the
figures of dances, herself laughing the while? It seemed
a long time ago now, and that he was cut off from her too,
and all of them, and that there was to be no expiation for
evermore for this that she had done.</p>

<p>How long she sat there she knew not. Everything was
a blank to her but this crushing consciousness that what
had happened could never be recalled; that her father and
she were forever separated now&mdash;and his face regarding
her with the terrible look she had seen in the garden; that
all the happy past was cut away from her, and she an outcast,
and a byword, and a disgrace to all that knew her.
And then she thought, in the very weariness of her misery,
that if she could only walk away anywhere&mdash;anywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>alone, so that no one should meet her or question her&mdash;until
she was broken and exhausted with fatigue, she
would then go back to her own small room, and lie down
on the bed, and try if sleep would procure some brief spell
of forgetfulness, some relief from her aching head and far
heavier heart. But when she rose she found that she was
trembling from weakness, and a kind of shiver as of cold
went through her, though the autumn day was warm
enough. She walked slowly, and almost dragged herself,
all the way home. Her hand shook so that she could
scarce undo the latch of the gate. She heard her grandmother
in the inner apartment, but she managed to creep
noiselessly up-stairs into her own little chamber, and there
she sank down on the bed, and lay in a kind of stupor,
pressing her hands on her throbbing brow.</p>

<p>It was some two hours afterward that her grandmother,
who did not know that Judith had returned, was walking
along the little passage, and was startled by hearing a low
moaning above&mdash;a kind of dull cry of pain&mdash;so slight that
she had to listen again ere she could be sure that it was not
mere fancy. Instantly she went up the few wooden steps
and opened the door. Judith was lying on the bed, with
all her things on, just as she had seen her go forth. And
then&mdash;perhaps the noise of the opening of the door had
wakened her&mdash;she started up, and looked at her grandmother
in a wild and dazed kind of way, as if she had just
shaken off some terrible dream.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother," she said, springing to her, and clinging
to her like a child, "it is not true&mdash;it is not true&mdash;it
cannot be true!"</p>

<p>But then she fell to crying&mdash;crying as if her heart would
break. The whole weight of her misery came back upon
her, and the hopelessness of it, and her despair.</p>

<p>"Why, good lass," said her grandmother, smoothing the
sun-brown hair that was buried in her bosom, and trying to
calm the violence of the girl's sobbing, "thou must not
take on so. Thy father may be angered, 'tis true, but there
will come brighter days for thee. Nay, take not on so,
good lass!"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother, you cannot understand!" she said,
and her whole form was shaken with sobs. "You cannot
understand. Grandmother, grandmother, there was&mdash;there
was but the one rose&mdash;in my garden&mdash;and that is gone
now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></h2>

<h3>IN TIME OF NEED.</h3>

<p>Late that night, in the apartment below, Tom Quiney
was seated by the big fireplace, staring moodily into the
chips and logs that had been lit there, the evenings having
grown somewhat chill now. There was a little parcel lying
unopened and unheeded on the table. He had not had
patience to wait for the fair of the morrow; he had ridden
all the way to Warwick to purchase something worthy of
Judith's acceptance, and he had come over to the cottage
in high hopes of her being still in that kindly mood that
reminded him of other days. Then came the good dame's
story of what had befallen; and how that the parson had
been over, bringing with him these terrible tidings; and
how that since then Judith would not hear of any one being
sent for, and would take no food, but was now lying there,
alone in the dark, moaning to herself at times. And the
good dame&mdash;as this tall young fellow sat there listening to
her, with his fists clinched, and the look on his face ever
growing darker&mdash;went on to express her fear that the parson
had been over-hard with her grandchild; that probably
he could not understand how her father had been the
very idol of her life-long worship; that the one thing she
was ever thinking of was how to win his approval&mdash;to be
rewarded by even a nod of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Nay, I liked not the manner of his speaking, when he
wur come to me in the garden," the old dame continued.
"I liked it not. He be sharp of tongue, the young pahrson,
and there were too much to my mind of discipline,
and chastening of proud spirits, and the like o' that. To
my mind he have not years enough to be placed in such
authority."</p>

<p>"The Church is behind him," said this young fellow,
almost to himself, and his eyes were burning darkly as he
spoke. "I may not put hand on him. The Church is behind
him. Marry, 'tis a goodly shelter for men that be of
the woman kind."</p>

<p>Then he looked up quickly, and his words were savage.&mdash;"What
think you, good grandmother, were one to seize
him by the neck and heel and break his back on the rail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>of Clopton's bridge? Were it not well done? By my life
I think it were well done!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, now," said she, quickly, for she was somewhat
alarmed, seeing his face set hard with passion and
his eyes afire. "I would have no brawling. There be
plenty of harm done already. Perchance the good pahrson
hath not spoken so harshly after all. In good sooth,
now, none but her own people can understand how the
wench hath ever looked up to her father&mdash;for a word or a
nod commending her, as I say&mdash;and when she be told now
that she hath wrought mischief, and caused herself to be
talked about, and her father vexed, and all the rest of the
tale, why 'tis like to drive her out of her mind. And now
this be all her cry&mdash;that she may see no one of her people
any more, she would bide with me here; 'Grandmother,
grandmother,' she saith, 'I will bide with you, if you will
suffer me. I will show myself in Stratford no more; they
shall have no shame through me.' Nay, but the wench be
half out of her senses, as I think, and saith wild things&mdash;that
she would go and sell herself to be a slave in the
Indies, could she restore the money to her father or bring
him back this that he hath lost. 'Tis a terrible plight for
the poor wench; and always she saith, 'Grandmother,
grandmother, let me bide with you; I will never go back
to New Place; grandmother, I can work as well as any,
and you will let me bide with you.' Poor lass&mdash;poor
lass!"</p>

<p>"But how came the parson to interfere?" Quiney said,
hotly. "I'll be sworn Judith's father did not write to him.
How came he to be preaching his discipline and chastisement?
How came he to be intrusted with the task of
abusing her and crushing the too proud spirit? By heavens,
now, there may be occasion erelong to tame some
one's proud spirit, but not the spirit of a defenceless young
maid&mdash;marry, that is work fit only for parsons. Man to
man is the better way&mdash;and it will come erelong."</p>

<p>"Nay, softly, softly, good Master Quiney," said the old
dame in her gentlest tones. "Would you mar all the
good opinion that Judith hath of you? Why, to-day, now,
just ere the parson came, I wur in the garden, putting
things straight a bit, and as she came through she says to
me, quite pleasant-like, I have just been across the fields,
grandmother, with Master Quiney&mdash;or Tom Quiney, as
she said, being friendly and pleasant-like&mdash;and I hear less
now of his quarrelling and fighting among the young men;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>and his business goeth on well; and to-morrow, grandmother,
he is going to buy me something at the fair."</p>

<p>"Said she all that?" he asked, quickly, and with a flush
of color rushing to his face.</p>

<p>"Marry did she, and looked pleased; for 'tis a right
friendly wench, and good-natured withal," the old dame
said, glad to see that these words had for the moment scattered
his wrath to the winds; and she went on for some
little time talking to him in her garrulous easy fashion
about Judith's frank and honest qualities, and her goodhearted
ways, and the pretty daintinesses of her coaxing
when she was so inclined. It was a story he was not loath
to listen to, and yet it seemed so strange; they were talking
of her almost as of one passed away&mdash;as if the girl lying
there in that darkened room, instead of torturing her
brain with incessant and lightning-like visions of all the
harm she had caused in London, were now far removed
from all such troubles, and hushed in the calm of death.</p>

<p>He went to the table and opened the box, and took out
the little present he had brought for Judith. It was a pair
of lace cuffs, with a slender silver circle at the wrist, the
lace going back from that in a succession of widening
leaves. It was not only a pretty present, it was also (in
proportion to his means) a costly one, as the old dame's
sharp eyes instantly saw.</p>

<p>"I think she would have been pleased with them," he
said, absently. And then he said,</p>

<p>"Good grandmother, it were of no use to lay them near
her in the morning&mdash;on a chair or at the window&mdash;that
perchance she might look at them?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," the grandmother said, shaking her head,
"'tis no child's trouble that hath befallen the poor wench,
that she can be comforted with pretty trifles."</p>

<p>"I meant not that," said he, flushing somewhat. "'Tis
that I would have her know that&mdash;that there were friends
thinking of her all the same&mdash;those that would rather have
her gladdened and tended and made much of, than&mdash;than&mdash;chidden
with any chastisement."</p>

<p>This word chastisement seemed to recall his anger.</p>

<p>"I say that Judith hath done no wrong at all," he said,
as if he were confronting some one not there; "and that
I will maintain; and let no man in my hearing say aught
else. Why, now, the story as you tell it, good grandmother&mdash;'tis
as plain as daylight&mdash;a child can see it&mdash;all
that she did was done to magnify her father and his writing;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>and if the villain sold the play&mdash;or let it slip out of
his hands&mdash;was that her doing? Doubtless it is a sore
mischance; but I see not that Judith is to be blamed for
it; and right well I know that if her father were to hear how
she is smitten down with grief he would be the first to say,
'Good lass, there is no such harm done. A great harm
would be your falling sick; get you up and out, seek your
friends again, and be happy as you were before.' That is
what he would say, I will take my oath of it; and if the
parson and his chastisements were to come across him, by
my life I would not seek to be in the parson's shoes!"</p>

<p>"I must make another trial with the poor wench," said
the good grandmother, rising, "that hath eaten nothing
all the day. In truth her only crying is to be left alone
now, and that hereafter I am to let her bide with me. It
be a poor shelter, I think, for one used to live in a noble
house; but there 'tis, so long as she wisheth it."</p>

<p>"Nay, but this cannot be suffered to go on, good Mistress
Hathaway," said he, as he rose and got his cap; "for
if Judith take no food, and will see no one, and be alone
with her trouble, of a surety she will fall ill. Now to-morrow
morning I will bring Prudence over. If any can
comfort her, Prudence can; and that she will be right
willing, I know. They have been as sisters."</p>

<p>"That be well thought of, Master Quiney," said the
grandmother, as she went to the door with him. "Take
care o' the ditch the other side of the way; it be main
dark o' nights now."</p>

<p>"Good-night to you, good grandmother," said he, as he
disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>But it was neither back home nor yet to Stratford town
that Tom Quiney thought of going all that long night.
He felt a kind of constraint upon him (and yet a constraint
that kept his heart warm with a secret satisfaction) that he
should play the part of a watch-dog, as it were&mdash;as if
Judith were sorely ill, or in danger, or in need of protection
somehow; and he kept wandering about in the dark,
never at any great radius from the cottage. His self-imposed
task was the easier now that, as the black clouds
overhead slowly moved before the soft westerly wind, gaps
were opened, and here and there clusters of stars were
visible, shedding a faint light down on the sombre roads
and fields and hedges. Many strange fancies occurred to
him during that long and silent night, as to what he could
do, or would like to do, for Judith's sake. Breaking the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>parson's neck was the first and most natural, and the most
easily accomplished; but fleeing the country, which he
knew must follow, did not seem so desirable a thing. He
wanted to do something&mdash;he knew not what. He wished
he had been less of a companion with the young men, and
less careful to show, with them, that Stratford town and
the county of Warwick could hold their own against all
comers. If he had been more considerate and gentle with
Judith, perhaps she would not have sought the society of
the parson. He knew he had not the art of winning her
over, like the parson. He could not speak so plausibly.
Nor had he the authority of the Church behind him. It
was natural for women to think much of that, and to be
glad of the shelter of authority. Parsons themselves (he
considered) were a kind of half women, being in women's
secrets, and entitled to speak to them in ghostly confidence.
But if Judith, now, wanted some one to do something
for her, no matter what, in his rough-and-ready way&mdash;well,
he wondered what that could be that he would
refuse. And so the dark hours went by.</p>

<p>With the gray of the dawn he began to cast his eyes
abroad, as if to see if any one were stirring, or approaching
the cluster of cottages nestled down there among the
trees. The daylight widened and spread up in the trembling
east; the fields and the woods became clear; here
and there a small tuft of blue smoke began to arise from
a cottage chimney. And now he was on Bardon Hill, and
could look abroad over the wide landscape lying between
Shottery and Stratford town; and if any one&mdash;any one
bringing lowering brows and further cruel speech to a
poor maid already stricken down and defenceless&mdash;had
been in sight, what then? Watchfully and slowly he went
down from the hill, and back to the meadows lying between
the hamlet and Stratford, there to interpose, as it
were, and question all comers. And well it was, for the
sake of peace and charity, that the good parson did not
chance to be early abroad on this still morning; and well
it was for the young man himself. There was no wise-eyed
Athene to descend from the clouds and bid this
wrathful Achilles calm his heart. He was only an English
country youth, though sufficiently Greek-like in form;
and he was hungry and gray-faced with his vigil of the
night, and not in a placable mood. Nay, when a young
man is possessed with the consciousness that he is the defender
of some one behind him&mdash;some one who is weak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>and feminine and suffering&mdash;he is apt to prove a dangerous
antagonist; and it was well for all concerned that he had
no occasion to pick a quarrel on this morning in these
quiet meadows. In truth he might have been more at
rest had he known that the good parson was in no hurry
to follow up his monitions of the previous day; he wished
these to sink into her mind and take root there, so that
thereafter might spring up such wholesome fruits as repentance
and humility, and the desire of godly aid and
counsel.</p>

<p>By-and-by he slipped away home, plunged his head into
cold water to banish the dreams of the night, and then,
having swallowed a cup of milk to stay his hunger, he
went along to Chapel Street, to see if he could have speech
of Prudence. He found that not only were all of the
household up and doing, but that Prudence herself was
ready to go out, being bent on one of her charitable errands;
and it needed but a word to alter the direction of
her kindness: of course she would at once go to see Judith.</p>

<p>"Truly I had fears of it," said she, as they went through
the fields, the pale, calm face having grown more and more
anxious as she listened to all that he had to tell her.
"Her father was as the light of the world to her. With
the others of us she hath ever been headstrong in a measure,
and careless&mdash;and yet so lovable withal, and merry,
that I for one could never withstand her&mdash;nay, I confess I
tried not to withstand her, for never knew I of any wilfulness
of hers springing from anything but good-nature and
her kind and generous ways. But that she was ever ready
to brave our opinions I know, and perchance make light
of our anxieties, we not having her courage; and in all
things she seemed to be a guide unto herself, and to walk
sure and have no fear. In all things but one. Indeed 'tis
true what her grandmother told you, and who should
know better than I, who was always with her? The
slightest wish of her father's&mdash;that was law to her. A
word of commending from him, and she was happy for
days. And think what this must be now&mdash;she that was so
proud of his approval&mdash;that scarce thought of aught else.
Nay, for myself I can see that they have told him all a
wrong story in London, that know I well; and 'tis no
wonder that he is vexed and angry; but Judith&mdash;poor
Judith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could say no more just then; she turned aside her
face somewhat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>"Do you know what she said to her grandmother, Prudence,
when she fell a crying? that there had been but
the one rose in her garden, and that was gone now."</p>

<p>"'Tis what Susan used to sing," said Prudence, with
rather trembling lips. "'<i>The rose is from my garden gone</i>,'
'twas called. Ay, and hath she that on her mind now?
Truly I wish that her mother and Susan had let me break
this news to her; none know as well as I what it must be
to her."</p>

<p>And here Tom Quiney quickly asked her whether it
was not clear to her that the parson had gone beyond his
mission altogether&mdash;and that in a way that would have to
be dealt with afterward, when all these things were
amended? Prudence, with some faint color in her pale
face, defended Master Blaise to the best of her power, and
said she knew he could not have been unduly harsh; nay,
had she not herself, just as he was setting forth, besought
him to be kind and considerate with Judith? Hereupon
Quiney rather brusquely asked what the good man could
mean by phrases about discipline and chastenings and
chastisements; to which Prudence answered gently that
these were but separate words, and that she was sure
Master Blaise had fulfilled what he undertook in a merciful
spirit, which was his nature. After that there was a
kind of silence between these two; perhaps Quiney considered
that no good end could be served at present by
stating his own ideas on that subject. The proper time
would come, in due course.</p>

<p>At length they reached the cottage. But here, to their
amazement, and to the infinite distress of Prudence, when
Judith's grandmother came down the wooden steps again,
she shook her head, saying that the wench would see no
one.</p>

<p>"I thought as 'twould be so," she said.</p>

<p>"But me, good grandmother! Me!" Prudence cried,
with tears in her eyes. "Surely she will not refuse to see
me!"</p>

<p>"No one, she saith," was the answer. "Poor wench,
her head do ache so bad. And when one would cheer her
or comfort her a morsel, 'tis another fit of crying&mdash;that
will wear her to skin and bone, if she do not pluck up better
heart. She hath eaten naught this morning neither;
'tis for no wilfulness, poor lass, for she tried an hour ago;
and now 'tis best as I think to leave her alone."</p>

<p>"By your leave, good grandmother," said Prudence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>with some firmness, "that will I not. If Judith be in such
trouble, 'tis not likely that I should go away and leave her.
It hath never been the custom between us two."</p>

<p>"As you will, Prudence," the grandmother said. "Young
hearts have their confidences among themselves. Perchance
you may be able to rouse her."</p>

<p>Prudence went up the stairs silently and opened the door.
Judith was lying on the bed, her face turned away from
the light, her hands clasped over her forehead.</p>

<p>"Judith!"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Judith," said her friend, going near, "I am come to
see you."</p>

<p>There was a kind of sob&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>"Judith, is your head so bad? Can I do nothing for you?"</p>

<p>She put over her hand&mdash;the soft and cool and gentle
touch of which had comforted many a sick-bed&mdash;and she
was startled to find that both Judith's hands and forehead
were burning hot.</p>

<p>"No, sweetheart," was the answer, in a low and broken
voice, "you can do nothing for me now."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Judith, take heart," Prudence said, and she
gently removed the hot fingers from the burning forehead,
and put her own cooler hand there, as if to dull the
throbbing of the pain. "Sweetheart, be not so cast down!
'Twill be all put right in good time."</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;never!" the girl said, without tears, but with
an abject hopelessness of tone. "It can never be undone
now. He said my name was become a mockery among
my father's friends. For myself, I would not heed that&mdash;nay,
they might say of me what they pleased&mdash;but that
my father should hear of it&mdash;a mockery and scorn&mdash;and
they think I cared so little for my father that I was ready
to give away his papers to any one pretending to be a
sweetheart and befooling me&mdash;and my father to know it
all, and to hear such things said&mdash;no, that can never be
undone now. I used to count the weeks and the days
and the very hours when I knew he was coming back&mdash;that
was the joy of my life to me&mdash;and now, if I were to
know that he were coming near to Stratford I should fly
and hide somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;in the river as lief as
not. Nay, I make no complaint. 'Tis my own doing, and
it cannot be undone now."</p>

<p>"Judith, Judith, you break my heart!" her friend cried.
"Surely to all troubles there must come an end."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>"Yes, yes," was the answer, in a low voice, and almost as
if she were speaking to herself. "That is right. There
will come an end. I would it were here now."</p>

<p>All Prudence's talking seemed to be of no avail. She
reasoned and besought&mdash;oftentimes with tears in her eyes&mdash;but
Judith remained quite listless and hopeless; she
seemed to be in a stunned and dazed condition after the
long sleeplessness of the night; and Prudence was afraid
that further entreaties would only aggravate her headache.</p>

<p>"I will go and get you something to eat now," said she.
"Your grandmother says you have had nothing since
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Do not trouble; 'tis needless, sweetheart," Judith said;
and then she added with a brief shiver, "but if you could
fetch a thick cloak, dear Prudence, and throw it over me&mdash;surely
the day is cold somewhat."</p>

<p>A few minutes after (so swift and eager was everybody
in the house) Judith was warmly wrapped up; and by the
side of the bed, on a chair, was some food the good grandmother
had been keeping ready, and also a flask of wine
that Quiney had brought with him.</p>

<p>"Look you, Judith," said Prudence, "here is some wine
that Thomas Quiney hath brought for you&mdash;'tis of a
rare quality, he saith&mdash;and you must take a little. Nay,
you must and shall, sweetheart; and then perchance you
may be able to eat."</p>

<p>She sipped a little of the wine; it was but to show her
gratitude and send him her thanks. She could not touch
the food. She seemed mostly anxious for rest and quiet;
and so Prudence noiselessly left her and stole down the
stair again.</p>

<p>Prudence was terribly perplexed and in a kind of despair
almost.</p>

<p>"I know not what to do," she said. "I would bring
over her mother and Susan, but that she begs and prays
me not to do that&mdash;nay, she cannot see them she says.
And there is no reasoning with her. It cannot be undone
now&mdash;that is her constant cry. What to do I cannot tell;
for surely, if she remain so, and take no comfort, she will
fall ill."</p>

<p>"Ay, and if that be so who is to blame?" said Quiney,
who was walking up and down in considerable agitation.
"I say that letter should never have been put into the
parson's hands. Was it meant to be conveyed to Judith?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>I warrant me it was not! Did her father say that he
wished her chidden? did he ask any of you to bid the parson
go to her with his upbraidings? would he himself have
been so quick and eager to chasten her proud spirit? I
tell you no. He is none of the parson kind. Vexed he
might have been, but he would have taken no vengeance.
What&mdash;on his own child? By heavens, I'll be sworn now
that if he were here, at this minute, he would take the girl
by the hand, and laugh at her for being so afraid of his
anger&mdash;ay, I warrant me he would&mdash;and would bid her be
of good cheer, and brighten her face, that was ever the
brightest in Warwickshire, as I have heard him say. That
would he&mdash;my life on it!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Prudence, wistfully, "if you could only persuade
Judith of that!"</p>

<p>"Persuade her?" said he. "Why, I would stake my
life that is what her father would do?"</p>

<p>"You could not persuade her," said Prudence, with a
hopeless air. "No; she thinks it is all over now between
her father and her. She is disgraced and put away from
him. She hath done him such injury, she says, as even his
enemies have never done. When he comes back again, she
says, to Stratford, she will be here, and she knows that he
will never come near this house; and that will be better
for her, she says, for she could never again meet him face
to face."</p>

<p>Well, all that day Judith lay there in that solitary room,
desiring only to be left alone; taking no food; the racking
pains in her head returning from time to time; and
now and again she shivered slightly, as if from cold. Tom
Quiney kept coming and going to hear news of her, or to
consult with Prudence as to how to rouse her from this
hopelessness of grief; and as the day slowly passed, he
grew more and more disturbed and anxious and restless.
Could nothing be done? Could nothing be done? was
his constant cry.</p>

<p>He remained late that evening, and Prudence stayed all
night at the cottage. In the morning he was over again
early, and more distressed than ever to hear that the girl
was wearing herself out with this agony of remorse&mdash;crying
stealthily when that she thought no one was near, and
hiding herself away from the light, and refusing to be
comforted.</p>

<p>But during the long and silent watches he had been taking
counsel with himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>"Prudence," said he, regarding her with a curious look,
"do you think now, if some assurance were come from
her father himself&mdash;some actual message from him&mdash;a
kindly message&mdash;some token that he was far indeed from
casting her away from him&mdash;think you Judith would be
glad to have that?"</p>

<p>"'Twould be like giving her life back to her," said the
girl, simply. "In truth I dread what may come of this;
'tis not in human nature to withstand such misery of
mind. My poor Judith, that was ever so careless and
merry!"</p>

<p>He hesitated for a second or two, and then he said,
looking at her, and speaking in a cautious kind of way.</p>

<p>"Because, when next I have need to write to London,
I might beg of some one&mdash;my brother Dick, perchance,
that is now in Bucklersbury, and would have small trouble
in doing such a service&mdash;I say I might beg of him to
go and see Judith's father, and tell him the true story, and
show him that she was not so much to blame. Nay, for
my part I see not that she was to blame at all, but for
over-kindness and confidence, and the wish to exalt her
father. The mischief that hath been wrought is the doing
of the scoundrel and villain on whose head I trust it may
fall erelong; 'twas none of hers. And if her father were
to have all that now put fairly and straight before him,
think you he would not be right sorry to hear that she had
taken his anger so much to heart, and was lying almost as
one dead at the very thought of it? I tell you, now, if all
this be put before him, and if he send her no comfortable
message&mdash;ay, and that forthwith, and gladly&mdash;I have far
misread him. And as for her, Prudence&mdash;'twould be welcome,
say you?"</p>

<p>"'Twould be of the value of all the world to her,"
Prudence said, in her direct and earnest way.</p>

<p>Well, he almost immediately thereafter left (seeing that
he could be of no further help to these women-folk), and
walked quickly back to Stratford, and to his house, which
was also his place of business. He seemed to hurry
through his affairs with speed; then he went up-stairs
and looked out some clothing; he took down a pair of
pistols and put some fresh powder in the pans, and made
a few other preparations. Next he went round to the
stable, and the stout little Galloway nag whinnied when
she saw him at the door.</p>

<p>"Well, Maggie, lass," said he, going into the stall, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>patting her neck, and stroking down her knees, "what
sayst thou? Wouldst like a jaunt that would carry thee
many a mile away from Stratford town? Nay, but if you
knew the errand, I warrant me you would be as eager as
I! What, then&mdash;a bargain, lass! By my life, you shall
have many a long day's rest in clover when this sharp
work is done!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>A LOST ARCADIA.</h3>

<p>It was on this same morning that Judith made a desperate
effort to rouse herself from the prostration into
which she had fallen. All through that long darkness
and despair she had been wearily and vainly asking herself
whether she could do nothing to retrieve the evil she
had wrought. Her good name might go&mdash;she cared little
for that now&mdash;but was there no means of making up to
her father the actual money he had lost? It was not forgiveness
she thought of, but restitution. Forgiveness was
not to be dreamed of; she saw before her always that
angered face she had beheld in the garden, and her wish
was to hide away from that, and be seen of it no more.
Then there was another thing: if she were to be permitted
to remain at the cottage, ought she not to show herself
willing to take a share of the humblest domestic
duties? Might not the good dame begin to regard her as
but a useless encumbrance? If it were so that no work
her ten fingers could accomplish would ever restore to her
father what he had lost through her folly, at least it might
win her grandmother's forbearance and patience. And so
it was on the first occasion of her head ceasing to ache
quite so badly she struggled to her feet (though she was
so languid and listless and weak that she could scarcely
stand), and put round her the heavy cloak that had been
lying on the bed, and smoothed her hair somewhat, and
went to the door. There she stood for a minute or two,
listening, for she would not go down if there were any
strangers about.</p>

<p>The house seemed perfectly still. There was not a
sound anywhere. Then, quite suddenly, she heard little
Cicely begin to sing to herself&mdash;but in snatches, as if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>were occupied with other matters&mdash;some well-known
rhymes to an equally familiar tune&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By the moon we sport and play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the night begins our day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we drink the dew doth fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trip it, dainty urchins all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly as the little bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two by two, and three by three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And about go we, go we."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">&mdash;and she made no doubt that the little girl was alone in
the kitchen. Accordingly, she went down. Cicely, who
was seated near the window and busily engaged in plucking
a fowl, uttered a slight cry when she entered, and
started up.</p>

<p>"Dear Mistress Judith," she said, "can I do aught for
you? Will you sit down? Dear, dear, how ill you do
look!"</p>

<p>"I am not at all ill, little Cicely," said Judith, as cheerfully
as she could, and she sat down. "Give me the fowl&mdash;I
will do that for you, and you can go and help my
grandmother in whatever she is at."</p>

<p>"Nay, not so," said the little maid, definitely refusing.
"Why should you?"</p>

<p>"But I wish it," Judith said. "Do not vex me now&mdash;go
and seek my grandmother, like a good little lass."</p>

<p>The little maid was thus driven to go, but it was with
another purpose. In about a couple of minutes she had
returned, and preceding her was Judith's grandmother.</p>

<p>"What! art come down, wench?" the old dame said,
patting her kindly on the shoulder. "That be so far well&mdash;ay,
ay, I like that now&mdash;that be better for thee than
lying all alone. But what would you with the little maid's
work, that you would take it out of her hands?"</p>

<p>"Why, if I am idle, and do nothing, grandmother, you
will be for turning me out of the house," the girl answered,
looking up with a strange kind of smile.</p>

<p>"Turn thee out of the house," said her grandmother,
who had just caught a better glimpse of the wan and tired
face. "Ay, that will I&mdash;and now. Come thy ways, wench;
'tis time for thee to be in the fresh air. Cicely, let be the
fowl now. Put some more wood on the fire, and hang on
the pot&mdash;there's a clever lass. And thou, grandchild,
come thy ways with me into the garden, and I warrant me
when thou comest back a cupful of barley-broth will do
thee no harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>Judith obeyed, though she would fain have sat still.
And then, when she reached the front door what a bewilderment
of light and color met her eyes! She stood as
one dazed for a second or two. The odors of the flowers
and the shrubs were so strange, moreover&mdash;pungent and
strange and full of memories. It seemed so long a time
since she had seen this wonderful glowing world and
breathed this keen air, that she paused on the stone flag
to collect her senses as it were. And then a kind of faintness
came over her, and perhaps she might have sank to
the ground, but that she laid hold of her grandmother's
arm.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, come thy ways and sit thee down, dearie," the
old dame said, imagining that the girl was but begging for
a little assistance in her walking. "I be main glad to see
thee out again. I liked not that lying there alone&mdash;nay, I
wur feared of it, and I bade Prudence send your mother
and Susan to see you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, good grandmother, no, no!" Judith pleaded,
with all the effort that remained to her.</p>

<p>"But yea, yea!" her grandmother said, sharply. "Foolish
wench, that would hide away from them that can best
aid thee! Ay, and knowest thou how the new disease, as
they call it, shows itself at the beginning? Why, with a
pinching of the face and sharp pains in the head. Wouldst
thou have me let thee lie there, and perchance go from
bad to worse, and not send for them&mdash;ay, and for Susan's
husband, if need were? Nay, but let not that fright thee,
good wench," she said, in a gentler way. "'Tis none so
bad as I thought, else you would not be venturing down
the stairs&mdash;nay, nay, there be no harm done as yet, I warrant
me&mdash;'tis a breath of fresh air to sharpen thee into a
hungry fit that will be the best doctor for thee. Here, sit
thee down and rest now, and when the barley-broth be
warm enough, Cicely shall bring thee out a dish of it.
Nay, I see no harm done. Keep up thy heart, lass; thou
wert ever a brave one&mdash;ay, what was there ever that could
daunt thee? and not the boldest of the youths but was
afraid of thy laugh and thy merry tongue. Heaven save
us, that thou should take on so! And if you would sell
yourself to work in slavery in the Indies, think you they
would buy a poor, weak, trembling creature? Nay, nay,
we will have to fetch back the roses to your cheeks ere
you make for that bargain, I warrant me!"</p>

<p>They were now seated in the little arbor. On entering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>Judith had cast her eyes round it in a strange and half-frightened
fashion; and now, as she sat there, she was
scarcely listening to the good-natured garrulity of the old
dame, which was wholly meant to cheer her spirits.</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said she, in a low voice, "think you
'twas really he that took away with him my father's play?"</p>

<p>"I know not how else it could have been come by," said
the grandmother, "but I pray you, child, heed not that
for the present. What be done and gone cannot be helped&mdash;let
it pass&mdash;there, there, now, what a lack of memory have
I, that should have shown thee the pretty lace cuffs that
Thomas Quiney left for thee&mdash;fit for a queen they be, to
be sure&mdash;ay, and the fine lace of them, and the silver, too.
He hath a free hand, he hath; 'tis a fair thing for any that
will be in life-partnership with him; 'twill not away,
marry 'twill not; 'twill bide in his nature&mdash;that will never
out of the flesh that's bred in the bone, as they say; and
I like to see a young man that be none of the miser kind,
but ready forth with his money where 'tis to please them
he hath a fancy for. A brave lad he is too, and one that
will hold his own; and when I told him that you were
pleased that his business went forward well, why, saith he,
as quick as quick, 'Said she that?' and if my old eyes fail
me not, I know of one that setteth greater share by your
good word than you imagine, wench."</p>

<p>She but half heard; she was recalling all that had happened
in this very summer-house.</p>

<p>"And think you, grandmother," said she, slowly, and
with absent eyes, "that when he was sitting here with us,
and telling us all about the Court doings, and about my
father's friends in London, and when he was so grateful
to us&mdash;or saying that he was so&mdash;for our receiving of him
here, think you that all the time he was planning to steal
my father's play, and to take it and sell it in London?
Grandmother can you think it possible? Could any one
be such a hypocrite? I know that he deceived me at the
first, but 'twas only a jest, and he confessed it all, and professed
his shame that he had so done. But, grandmother,
think of him&mdash;think of how he used to speak&mdash;and ever so
modest and gentle; is't possible that all the time he was
playing the thief, and looking forward to the getting away
to London to sell what he had stolen?"</p>

<p>"For love's sake, sweetheart, heed that man no more!
'tis all done and gone&mdash;there can come no good of vexing
thyself about it," her grandmother said. "Be he villain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>or not, 'twill be well for all of us that we never hear his
name more. In good sooth I am as much to blame as thou
thyself, child, for the encouraging him to come about, and
listening to his gossip&mdash;beshrew me, that I should have
meddled in such matters, and not bade him go about his
business! But 'tis all past and gone now, as I say&mdash;there
be no profit in vexing thyself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Past and gone, grandmother!" she exclaimed, and yet
in a listless way. "Yes&mdash;but what remains? Good grandmother,
perchance you did not hear all that the parson
said. 'Tis past and gone, truly&mdash;and more than you
think."</p>

<p>The tone in which she uttered these words somewhat
startled the good dame, who looked at her anxiously.
And then she said,</p>

<p>"Why, now, I warrant me the barley-broth will be hot
enough by this time: I will go fetch thee a cupful, wench&mdash;'twill
put warmth in thy veins, it will&mdash;ay, and cheer thy
heart too."</p>

<p>"Trouble not, good grandmother," she said. "I would
as lief go back to my room now. The light hurts my eyes
strangely."</p>

<p>"Back to your room? that shall you not!" was the
prompt answer, but not meant unkindly. "You shall wait
here, wench, till I bring thee that will put some color in
thy white face&mdash;ay, and some of Thomas Quiney's wine
withal; and if the light hurt thee, sit farther back, then&mdash;of
a truth 'tis no wonder, after thou hast hid thyself like a
dormouse for so long."</p>

<p>And so she went away to the house. But she was
scarcely gone when Judith&mdash;in this extreme silence that
the rustling of a leaf would have disturbed&mdash;heard certain
voices; and listening more intently she made sure that the
new-comers must be Susan and her mother, whom Prudence
had asked to walk over. Instantly she got up,
though she had to steady herself for a moment by resting
her hand on the table; and then, as quickly as she could,
and as noiselessly, she stole along the path to the cottage,
and entered, and made her way up to her own room. She
fancied she had not been heard. She would rather be
alone. If they had come to accuse her, what had she to
answer? Why, nothing: they might say of her what they
pleased now, it was all deserved; only, the one denunciation
of her that she had listened to&mdash;the one she had heard
from the parson&mdash;seemed like the ringing of her death-knell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>Surely there was no need to repeat that? They
could not wish to repeat it, did they but know all it meant
to her.</p>

<p>Then the door was quietly opened, and her sister appeared,
bearing in one hand a small tray.</p>

<p>"I have brought you some food, Judith, and a little
wine, and you must try and take them, sweetheart," said
she. "'Twas right good news to us that you had come
down and gone into the garden for a space. In truth,
making yourself ill will not mend matters; and Prudence
was in great alarm."</p>

<p>She put the tray on a chair, for there was no table in the
room&mdash;but Judith, finding that her sister had not come to
accuse her, but was in this gentle mood, said quickly and
eagerly,</p>

<p>"Oh, Susan, you can tell me all that I would so fain
know! You must have heard, for my father speaks to
you of all his affairs, and at your own wedding you must
have heard when all these things were arranged. Tell me,
Susan&mdash;I shall have a marriage-portion, shall I not?&mdash;and
how much, think you? Perchance not so large as yours,
for you are the elder, and Dr. Hall was ever a favorite
with my father. But I shall have a marriage-portion, Susan,
shall I not? nay, it may already be set aside for me."</p>

<p>And then the elder sister did glance somewhat reproachfully
at her.</p>

<p>"I wonder you should be thinking of such things, Judith,"
said she.</p>

<p>"Ah, but 'tis not as you imagine," the girl said, with
the same pathetic eagerness. "Tis in this wise now:
would my father take it in a measure to repay him for the
ill that I have done? Would it make up the loss, Susan,
or a part of it? Would he take it, think you? Ah, but
if he would do that!"</p>

<p>"Why, that were an easy way out of the trouble, assuredly!"
her sister exclaimed. "To take the marriage-portion
that is set aside for thee&mdash;and if I mistake not, 'tis all
provided&mdash;ay, and the Rowington copyhold, which will fall
to thee, if 'tis not thine already; truly, 'twere a wise thing
to take these to make good this loss, and then, when you
marry, to have to give you your marriage-portion all the
same!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, not so, Susan!" her sister cried, quickly.
"What said you? The Rowington copyhold also? and
perchance mine already? Susan, would it make good the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>loss? Would all taken together make good the loss?
For, as Heaven is my witness, I will never marry&mdash;nor
think of marrying&mdash;but rejoice all the days of my life if
my father would but take these to satisfy him of the injury
I have done him. Nay, but is't possible, Susan? Will he
do that for me&mdash;as a kindness to me? I have no right to
ask for such&mdash;but&mdash;but if only he knew&mdash;if only he knew!"</p>

<p>The tears were running down her face; her hands were
clasped in abject entreaty.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, you know not what you ask," her sister
said, but gently. "When you marry, your marriage-portion
will have to be in accordance with our position in
the town&mdash;my father would not have it otherwise; were
you to surrender that now, would he let one of his daughters
go forth from his house as a beggar, think you? Or
what would her husband say to be so treated? You might
be willing to give up these, but my father could not, and
your husband would not."</p>

<p>"Susan, Susan, I wish for no marriage," she cried; "I
will stay with my grandmother here; she is content that
I should bide with her; and if my father will take these,
'twill be the joy of my life; I shall wish for no more; and
New Place shall come to no harm by me; 'tis here that
I am to bide. Think you he would take them, Susan&mdash;think
you he would take them?" she pleaded; and in her
excitement she got up, and tried to walk about a little,
but with her hands still clasped. "If one were to send to
London now&mdash;a message&mdash;or I would walk every foot of
the way did I but think he would do this for me&mdash;oh, no!
no! no! I durst not&mdash;I durst never see him more&mdash;he
has cast me off&mdash;and&mdash;and I deserve no less!"</p>

<p>Her sister went to her and took her by the hand.</p>

<p>"Judith, you have been in sore trouble, and scarce
know what you say," she said, in that clear, calm way of
hers. "But this is now what you must do. Sit down
and take some of this food. As I hear, you have scarce
tasted anything these two days. You have always been
so wild and wayward; now must you listen to reason and
suffer guidance."</p>

<p>She made her sit down. The girl took a little of the
broth, some of the spiced bread, and a little of the wine,
but it was clear that she was forcing herself to it; her
thoughts were elsewhere. And scarcely had she finished
this make-believe of a repast when she turned to her sister
and said, with a pathetic pleading in her voice,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>"And is it not possible, Susan? Surely I can do something!
It is so dreadful to think of my father imagining
that I have done him this injury, and gone on the same
way, careless of what has happened. That terrifies me at
night! Oh, if you but knew what it is in the darkness, in
the long hours, and none to call to, and none to give you
help; and to think that these are the thoughts he has of
me; that it was all for a sweetheart I did it&mdash;that I gave
away his writing to please a sweetheart&mdash;and that I care
not for what has happened, but would do the like again
to-morrow! It is so dreadful in the night."</p>

<p>"I would comfort you if I could, Judith," said her sister,
"but I fear me you must trust to wiser counsel than mine.
In truth I know not whether all this can be undone, or
how my father regards it at the moment; for at the time
of the writing they were all uncertain. But surely now
you would do well to be ruled by some one better able to
guide you than any of us women-folk; Master Blaise hath
been most kind and serviceable in this as in all other
matters, and hath written to your father in answer to his
letter, so that we have had trust and assurance in his direction.
And you also&mdash;why should you not seek his aid
and counsel?"</p>

<p>At the mere mention of the parson's name Judith shivered
instinctively, she scarce knew why.</p>

<p>"Judith," her sister continued, regarding her watchfully,
"to-morrow, as I understand, Master Blaise is coming
over here to see you."</p>

<p>"May not I be spared that? He hath already brought
his message," the girl said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Nay, he comes but in kindness&mdash;or more than kindness,
if I guess aright. Bethink you, Judith," she said,
"'tis not only the loss of the money&mdash;or great or small I
know not&mdash;that hath distressed my father. There was
more than that. Nay, do not think that I am come to reproach
you; but will it not be ever thus so long as you
will be ruled by none, but must always go your own way?
There was more than merely concerned money affairs in
my father's letter, as doubtless Master Blaise hath told
you; and then, think of it, Judith, how 'twill be when the
bruit of the story comes down to Stratford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I care not," was the perfectly calm answer. "That is
for me to bear. Can Master Blaise tell me how I may restore
to my father this that he hath lost? Then his visit
might be more welcome, Susan."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>"Why will you harden your heart so?" the elder sister
said, with some touch of entreaty in her tone. "Nay, think
of it, Judith! Here is an answer to all. If you but listen
to him, and favor him, you will have one always with you
as a sure guide and counsellor; and who then may dare
say a word against you?"</p>

<p>"Then he comes to save my good name?" the girl said,
with a curious change of manner. "Nay, I will give him
no such tarnished prize!"</p>

<p>And here it occurred to the elder sister, who was sufficiently
shrewd and observant, that her intercession did
not seem to be producing good results, and she considered
it better that the parson should speak for himself. Indeed,
she hoped she had done no mischief, for this that
she now vaguely suggested had for long been the dream
and desire of both her mother and herself; and at this moment,
if ever, there was a chance of Judith's being obedient
and compliant. Not only did she forthwith change
the subject, but also she managed to conquer the intense
longing that possessed her to learn something further
about the young man who (as she imagined) had for a
time captured Judith's fancies. She gave her sister what
news there was in the town. She besought her to take
care of herself, and to go out as much as possible, for that
she was looking far from well. And, finally, when the
girl confessed that she was fain to lie down for a space
(having slept so little during these two nights), she put
some things over her and quietly left, hoping that she
might soon get to sleep.</p>

<p>Judith did not rest long, however. The question whether
the sacrifice of her marriage-portion might not do
something toward retrieving the disaster she had caused
was still harassing her mind; and then again there was the
prospect of the parson coming on the morrow. By-and-by,
when she was certain that her mother and sister were
gone, she went down-stairs, and began to help in doing this
or the other little thing about the house. Her grandmother
was out-of-doors, and so did not know, to interfere, though
the small maid-servant remonstrated as best she might.
Luckily, however, nature was a more imperative monitress,
and again and again the girl had to sit down from sheer
physical weakness.</p>

<p>But there came over a visitor in the afternoon who restored
to her something of her old spirit. It was little
Willie Hart, who, having timidly tapped at the open door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>without, came along the passage and entered the dusky
chamber where she was.</p>

<p>"Ah, sweetheart," said she (but with a kind of sudden
sob in her throat), "have you come to see me?"</p>

<p>"I heard that you were not well, cousin," said he, and
he regarded her with troubled and anxious eyes as she
stooped to kiss him.</p>

<p>"Nay, I am well enough," said she, with as much cheerfulness
as she could muster. "Fret not yourself about
that. And what a studious scholar you are, Cousin Willie,
to be sure, that must needs bring your book with you!
Were I not so ignorant myself, I should hear you your
tasks; but you would but laugh at me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis no task-book, Judith," said he, diffidently. "'Twas
Prudence who lent it to me." And then he hesitated,
through shyness.</p>

<p>"Why, you know, Judith," he said, "you have spoken to
me many a time about Sir Philip Sidney; and I was asking
this one and the other, at times, and Prudence said she
would show me a book he had written that belongs to her
brother. And then to-day, when I went to her, she bade
me bring the book to you, and to read to you, for that you
were not well and might be pleased to hear it, she not being
able to come over till the morrow."</p>

<p>"In truth, now, that was well thought of, and friendly,"
said she, and she put her hand in a kindly fashion on his
shoulder. "And you have come all the way over to read
to me! see you how good a thing it is to be wise and instructed.
Well, then, we will go and sit by the door, that
you may have more of light; and if my grandmother catch
us at such idleness, you shall have to defend me&mdash;you shall
have to defend me, sweetheart&mdash;for you are the man of us
two, and I must be shielded."</p>

<p>So they went to the door, and sat down on the step, the
various-colored garden and the trees and the wide heavens
all shining before them.</p>

<p>"And what is the tale, Cousin Willie?" said she, quite
pleasantly (for indeed she was glad to see the boy, and to
chat with one who had no reproaches for her, who knew
nothing against her, but was ever her true lover and
slave). "Nay, if it be by Sir Philip Sidney, 'twill be of
gallant and noble knights, assuredly."</p>

<p>"I know not, Cousin Judith," said he; "I but looked
at the beginning as I came through the fields. And this
is how it goes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p><p>He opened the book and began to read&mdash;</p>

<p>"'It was in the time that the Earth begins to put on
her new apparel against the approach of her lover, and
that the sun running a most even course becomes an indifferent
arbiter between the night and the day, when the
hopeless shepherd Strephon was come to the sands which
lie against the island of Cythera, where, viewing the place
with a heavy kind of delight, and sometimes casting his
eyes to the isleward, he called his friendly rival the pastor
Claius unto him, and, setting first down in his darkened
countenance a doleful copy of what he would speak, "O
my Claius," said he&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Thus he went on; and as he read, her face grew more
and more wistful. It was a far-off land that she heard of;
and beautiful it was; it seemed to her that she had been
dwelling in some such land, careless and all unknowing.</p>

<p>"'The third day after,'" she vaguely heard him say,
"'in the time that the morning did strew roses and violets
in the heavenly floor against the coming of the sun, the
nightingales, striving one with the other which could in
most dainty variety recount their wrong-caused sorrow,
made them put off their sleep, and rising from under a
tree, which that night had been their pavilion, they went
on their journey, which by-and-by welcomed Musidorus's
eyes with delightful prospects. There were hills which
garnished their proud heights with stately trees; humble
valleys whose base estate seemed comforted with the refreshing
of silver rivers; meadows enamelled with all sorts
of eye-pleasing flowers; thickets which, being lined with
most pleasant shade, were witnessed so to by the cheerful
disposition of many well-tuned birds; each pasture stored
with sheep, feeding with sober security, while the pretty
lambs, with bleating oratory, craved the dams' comfort;
here a shepherd's boy piping, as though he should never
be old; there a young shepherdess knitting, and withal
singing; and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands
to work, and her hands kept time to her voice-music.'"</p>

<p>Surely she had herself been living in some such land of
pleasant delights, without a thought that ever it would end
for her, but that each following day would be as full of
mirth and laughter as its predecessor. She scarcely listened
to the little lad now; she was looking back over
the years, so rare and bright and full of light and color
were they&mdash;and always a kind of music in them&mdash;and
laughter at the sad eyes of lovers. She had never known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>how happy she had been. It was all distant now&mdash;the
idle flower-gathering in the early spring-time; the afternoon
walking in the meadows, she and Prudence together
(with the young lads regarding them askance); the open
casements on the moonlit nights, to hear the madrigal
singing of the youths going home; or the fair and joyous
mornings that she was allowed to ride away in the direction
of Oxford, to meet her father and his companions
coming in to Stratford town. And now, when next he
should come&mdash;to all of them, and all of them welcoming
him&mdash;even neighbors and half-strangers&mdash;and he laughing
to them all, and getting off his horse, and calling for a cup
of wine as he strode into the house, where should she be?
Not with all of these&mdash;not laughing and listening to the
merry stories of the journey&mdash;but away by herself, hiding
herself, as it were, and thinking, alone.</p>

<p>"Dear Judith, but why are you crying?" said the little
lad, as he chanced to look up; and his face was of an instant
and troubled anxiety.</p>

<p>"Why, 'tis a fair land&mdash;oh, indeed, a fair land," said she,
with an effort at regarding the book, and pretending to be
wholly interested in it. "Nay, I would hear more of Musidorus,
sweetheart, and of that pretty country. I pray
you continue the reading&mdash;continue the reading, sweetheart
Willie. Nay, I never heard of a fairer country I assure
thee, in all the wide world!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>A RESOLVE.</h3>

<p>Then that night, as she lay awake in the dark, her incessant
imaginings shaped themselves toward one end.
This passion of grief she knew to be unavailing and fruitless.
Something she would try to do, if but to give evidence
of her <span class="err" title="original: contritition">contrition</span>: for how could she bear that her
father should think of her as one having done him this
harm and still going on light-hearted and unconcerned?
The parson was coming over on the morrow. And if she
were to put away her maidenly pride (and other vague
dreams that she had sometimes dreamed), and take it that
her consent would re-establish her in the eyes of those who
were now regarding her askance, and make her peace with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>her own household? And if the surrender of her marriage-portion
and her interest in the Rowington copyhold (whatever
it might be) were in a measure to mitigate her father's
loss? It was the only thing she could think of. And if
at times she looked forward with a kind of shudder (for in
the night-time all prospects wear a darker hue) to her existence
as the parson's wife, again there came to her the
reflection that it was not for her to repine. Some sacrifice
was due from her. And could she not be as resolute as
the daughter of the Gileadite? Oftentimes she had heard
the words read out in the still afternoon: "Now when
Iphtah came to Mizpeh unto his house, behold his daughter
came out to meet him with timbrels and dances: which
was his only child; he had none other, son nor daughter.
And when he saw her he rent his clothes, and said, Alas!
my daughter, thou hast brought me low, and art of them
that trouble me." The Jewish maiden had done no ill, and
yet was brave to suffer. Why should she repine at any
sacrifice demanded of her to atone for her own wrong-doing?
What else was there? She hoped that Susan and
her mother would be pleased now, and that her father and
his friends in London would not have any serious loss to
regret. There was but the one way, she said to herself
again and again. She was almost anxious for the parson
to come over, to see if he would approve.</p>

<p>With the daylight her determination became still more
clear, and also she saw more plainly the difficulties before
her; for it could not be deemed a very seemly and maidenly
thing that she, on being asked to become a bride (and
she had no doubt that was his errand), should begin to
speak of her marriage-portion. But would he understand?
Would he help her over her embarrassment? Nay, she
could not but reflect, here was an opportunity for his
showing himself generous and large-minded. He had always
professed, or at least intimated, that his wish to have
her for wife was based mostly on his care for herself and
his regard for the general good of the pious community
to which he belonged. She was to be a helpmate for one
laboring in the Lord's vineyard; she was to be of service
in the church; she was to secure for herself a constant
and loving direction and guidance. And now, if he wished
to prove all this&mdash;if he wished to show himself so noble
and disinterested as to win for himself her life-long gratitude&mdash;what
if he were to take over all her marriage-portion,
as that might be arranged, and forthwith and chivalrously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>hand it back again, so that her grievous fault should
so far be condoned? If the girl had been in her usual
condition of health and spirits, it is probable that she
would have regarded this question with a trifle of scepticism
(for she was about as shrewd in such matters as Susan
herself); nay, it is just probable that she might have experienced
a malicious joy in putting him to the proof.
But she was in despair; her nerves were gone through
continual wakefulness and mental torture; this was the
only direction in which she saw light before her, and she
regarded it, not with her ordinary faculty of judgment, but
with a kind of pathetic hope.</p>

<p>Master Blaise arrived in the course of the morning. His
reception was not auspicious, for the old dame met him at
the gate, and made more than a show of barring the way.</p>

<p>"Indeed, good sir," said she, firmly, "the wench be far
from well now, and I would have her left alone."</p>

<p>He answered that his errand was of some importance,
and that he must crave a few minutes' interview. Both
her mother and sister, he said, were aware he was coming
over to see her, and had made no objection.</p>

<p>"No, no, perchance not," the grandmother said, though
without budging an inch, "but she be under my care now,
and I will have no harm befall her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harm! good Mistress Hathaway?" said he.</p>

<p>"Well, she be none so strong as she were&mdash;and&mdash;and
perchance there hath been overmuch lecturing of the poor
lass. Nay, I doubt not 'twas meant in kindness; but there
hath been overmuch of it, as I reckon, and what I say is,
if the wench have done amiss, let those that have the right
to complain come to her. Nay, 'twas kindness, good sir;
'twas well meant, I doubt not; and 'tis your calling belike
to give counsel and reproof; I say naught against that,
but I am of a mind to have my grandchild left alone at
present."</p>

<p>"If you refuse me, good Mistress Hathaway," said he,
quite courteously and calmly, "there is no more to be
said. But I imagine that her mother and sister will be
surprised. And as for the maiden herself&mdash;go you by her
wishes?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not I," was the bold answer. "I know better
than all of them together. For to speak plainly with you,
good Master Parson, your preaching must have been oversharp
when last you were within here&mdash;and was like to
have brought the wench to death's door thereafter; marry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>she be none so far recovered as to risk any further of such
treatment. Perchance you meant no harm; but she is
proud and high-spirited, and by your leave, good sir, we
will see her a little stronger and better set up ere she have
any more of the discipline of the church bestowed on her."</p>

<p>It was well that Judith appeared at this juncture, for
the tone of the old dame's voice was growing more and
more tart.</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said she, "I would speak with Master
Blaise."</p>

<p>"Get thee within-doors at once, I tell thee, wench!"
was the peremptory rejoinder.</p>

<p>"No, good grandmother, so please you," Judith said,
"I must speak with him. There is much of importance
that I have to say to him. Good sir, will you step into the
garden?"</p>

<p>The old dame withdrew, sulky and grumbling, and evidently
inclined to remain within ear-shot, lest she should
deem it necessary to interfere. Judith preceded Master
Blaise to the door of the cottage, and asked the little maid
to bring out a couple of chairs. As she sat down he could
not but observe how wan and worn her face was, and how
listless she was in manner; but he made no comment on
that; he only remarked that her grandmother seemed in
no friendly mood this morning, and that only the fact that
his mission was known to Susan and her mother had
caused him to persist.</p>

<p>It was clear that this untoward reception had disconcerted
him somewhat; and it was some little time before
he could recover that air of mild authority with which he
was accustomed to convey his counsels. At first he confined
himself to telling Judith what he had done on behalf
of her mother and Susan, in obedience to their wishes;
but by and by he came to herself and her own situation;
and he hoped that this experience through which she had
passed, though it might have caused her bitter distress for
the time, would eventually make for good. If the past
could not be recalled, at least the future might be made
safe. Indeed one or two phrases he had used sounded as
if they had done some previous service, perhaps he had
consulted with Mistress Hall ere making this appeal&mdash;but
in any case Judith was not listening so particularly as to
think of that&mdash;she seemed to know beforehand what he
had to say.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he was himself a little surprised at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>tacit acquiescence. He had always had to argue with
Judith, and many a time he had found that her subtle feminine
wit was capable of extricating herself from what he
considered a defenceless position. But now she sat almost
silent. She seemed to agree to everything. There was
not a trace left of the old audacious self-reliance, nor yet
of those saucy rejoinders which were only veiled by her
professed respect for his cloth&mdash;she was at his mercy.</p>

<p>And so, growing bolder, he put in his own personal
claim. He said little that he had not said or hinted on
previous occasions; but now all the circumstances were
changed; this heavy misfortune that had befallen her was
but another and all too cogent reason why she should accept
his offer of shelter and aid and counsel, seeing into
what pitfalls her own unguided steps were like to lead her.</p>

<p>"I speak the words of truth and soberness," said he, as
he sat and calmly regarded her downcast face, "and make
no appeal to the foolish fancies of a young and giddy-headed
girl&mdash;for that you are no longer, Judith. The
years are going by. There must come a time in life when
the enjoyment of the passing moment is not all in all&mdash;when
one must look to the future, and make provision for
sickness and old age. Death strikes here and there;
friends fall away. What a sad thing it were to find one's
self alone, the dark clouds of life thickening over, and
none by to help and cheer. Then your mother and sister,
Judith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she said, almost in despair&mdash;"I know
'twould please them."</p>

<p>And then she reflected that this was scarcely the manner
in which she should receive his offer, that was put before
her so plainly and with so much calm sincerity.</p>

<p>"I pray you, good sir," said she, in a kind of languid
way, "forgive me if I answer you not as frankly as might
be. I have been ill; my head aches now; perchance I
have not followed all you said. But I understand it&mdash;I
understand it&mdash;and in all you say there is naught but good
intention."</p>

<p>"Then it is yes, Judith?" he exclaimed; and for the
first time there was a little brightness of ardor&mdash;almost of
triumph&mdash;in this clearly conceived and argued wooing.</p>

<p>"It would please my mother and sister," she repeated,
slowly. "They are afraid of some story coming from
London about&mdash;about&mdash;what is passed. This would be an
answer, would it not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>"Why, yes!" he said, confidently, for he saw that she
was yielding (and his own susceptibilities were not likely
to be wounded in that direction). "Think you we should
heed any tavern scurrility? I trow not! There would be
the answer plain and clear&mdash;if you were my wife, Judith."</p>

<p>"They would be pleased," again she said, and her eyes
were absent. And then she added, "I pray you pardon
me, good sir, if I speak of that which you may deem out
of place, but&mdash;but if you knew&mdash;how I have been striving
to think of some means of repairing the wrong I have
done my father, you would not wonder that I should be
anxious, and perchance indiscreet. You know of the loss
I have caused him and his companions. How could I
ever make that good with the work of my own hands?
That is not possible; and yet when I think of how he
hath toiled for all of us&mdash;late and early, as it were&mdash;why,
good sir, I have myself been bold enough to chide him&mdash;or
to wish that I were a man, to ride forth in the morning
in his stead and look after the land; and then that his own
daughter should be the means of taking from him what he
hath earned so hardly&mdash;that I should never forget; 'twould
be on my mind year after year, even if he were himself to
try to forget it."</p>

<p>She paused for a second; the mere effort of speaking
seemed to fatigue her.</p>

<p>"There is but the one means, as I can think, of showing
him my humble sorrow for what hath been done&mdash;of making
him some restitution. I know not what my marriage-portion
may be&mdash;but 'twill be something&mdash;and Susan saith
there is a part of the manor of Rowington, also, that would
fall to me; now, see you, good Master Blaise, if I were to
give these over to my father in part quittance of this injury&mdash;or
if, belike&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;husband would do that&mdash;out
of generosity and nobleness&mdash;would not my father be
less aggrieved?"</p>

<p>She had spoken rather quickly and breathlessly (to get
over her embarrassment), and now she regarded him with
a strange anxiety, for so much depended on his answer!
Would he understand her motives? Would he pardon her
bluntness? Would he join her in this scheme of restitution?</p>

<p>He hesitated only for a moment.</p>

<p>"Dear Judith," he said, with perfect equanimity, "such
matters are solely within the province of men, and not at
the disposition of women, who know less of the affairs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>the world. Whatever arrangements your father may have
made in respect of your marriage-portion&mdash;truly I have
made no inquiry in that direction&mdash;he will have made with
due regard to his own circumstances, and with regard to
the family and to your future. Would he be willing to upset
these in order to please a girlish fancy? Why, in all
positions in life pecuniary losses must happen; and a man
takes account of these; and is he likely to recover himself
at the expense of his own daughter?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but if she be willing! If she would give all that
she hath, good sir!" she cried, quickly.</p>

<p>"'Twould be but taking it from one pocket to put it in
the other," said he, in his patient and forbearing way. "I
say not, if a man were like to become bankrupt, that his
family might not forego their expectations in order to save
him; but your father is one in good position. Think you
that the loss is so great to him? In truth it cannot
be."</p>

<p>The eagerness fell away from her face. She saw too
clearly that he could not understand her at all. She did
not reckon her father's loss in proportion to his wealth&mdash;in
truth, she could not form the faintest notion of what that
loss might be; all her thought was of her winning back
(in some remote day, if that were still possible to her) to
her father's forgiveness, and the regarding of his face as
no longer in dread wrath against her.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, seeing that she sat silent and distraught
(for all the hope had gone out of her), "in every profession
and station in life a man must have here or there a
loss, as I say; but would he rob his family to make that
good? Surely not. Of what avail might that be? 'Tis
for them that he is working, 'tis not for himself; why
should he take from them to build up a property which
must in due course revert and become theirs? I pray
you put such fancies out of your head, Judith. Women
are not accustomed to deal with such matters; 'tis better
to have them settled in the ordinary fashion. Were I you
I would leave it in your father's hands."</p>

<p>"And have him think of me as he is thinking now!"
she said, in a kind of wild way. "Ah, good sir, you know
not!&mdash;you know not! Every day that passes is but the
deeper misery&mdash;for&mdash;for he will be hardened in the belief&mdash;'twill
be fixed in his mind forever&mdash;that his own daughter
did him this wrong, and went on lightly&mdash;not heeding&mdash;perchance
to seek another sweetheart. This he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>thinking now, and I&mdash;what can I do?&mdash;being so far away
and none to help!"</p>

<p>"In truth, dear Judith," said he, "you make too much of
your share in what happened. 'Tis not to you your father
should look for reparation of his loss, but to the scoundrel
who carried the play to London. What punishment would
it be for him&mdash;or what gain to your father&mdash;that your
father should upset the arrangements he has made for the
establishment and surety of his own family? Nay, I pray
you put aside such a strange fancy, dear heart, and let
such things take their natural course."</p>

<p>"In no wise, in no wise!" she exclaimed, almost in despair.
"In truth I cannot. 'Twould kill me were nothing
to be done to appease my father's anger; and I thought
that if he were to learn that you had sought me in marriage&mdash;and&mdash;and
agreed that such restitution as I can
make should be made forthwith&mdash;or afterward, as might
be decided&mdash;but only that he should know now that I give
up everything he had intended for me&mdash;then I should have
great peace of mind."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Judith," said he, somewhat coldly, "I could
be no party to any such foolish freak&mdash;nay, not even in
intention, whatever your father might say to it. The very
neighbors would think I was bereft of my senses. And
'twould be an ill beginning of our life together&mdash;in which
there must ever be authority and guidance, as well as
dutiful obedience&mdash;if I were to yield to what every one
must perceive to be an idle and fantastic wish. I pray
you consult your own sober judgment; at present you are
ailing, and perturbed; rest you awhile until these matters
have calmed somewhat, and you will see them in their
true light."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, hurriedly and absently&mdash;"no, no,
good sir, you know not what you ask. Rest? Nay, one
way or the other this must be done, and forthwith. I know
not what he may have intended for me; but be it large or
small, 'tis all that I have to give him&mdash;I can do no more
than that&mdash;and then&mdash;then there may be some thoughts of
rest."</p>

<p>She spoke as if she were scarcely aware of the good
parson's presence; and in truth, though he was not one to
allow any wounded self-love to mar his interests, he could
not conceal from himself that she was considering the proposal
he had put before her mainly, if not wholly, with a
view to the possible settlement of these troubles and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>appeasing of her friends. Whether, in other circumstances,
he might not have calmly overlooked this slight,
needs not now be regarded; in the present circumstances&mdash;that
is to say, after her announced determination to
forego every penny of her marriage-portion&mdash;he did take
notice of it, and with some sharpness of tone, as if he were
truly offended.</p>

<p>"Indeed you pay me no compliment, Judith," said he.
"I come to offer you the shelter of an honest man's home,
an honorable station as his wife, a life-long guidance and
protection; and what is your answer?&mdash;that perchance
you may make use of such an offer to please your friends
and to pay back to your father what you foolishly think
you owe him. If these be the only purposes you have in
view&mdash;and you seem to think of none other&mdash;'twould be a
sorry forecast for the future, as I take it. At the very beginning
an act of madness! Nay, I could be no party to
any such thing. If you refuse to be guided by me in great
matters, how could I expect you to be guided in small?"</p>

<p>These words, uttered in his clear and precise and definite
manner, she but vaguely understood (for her head
troubled her sorely, and she was tired, and anxious to be
at rest) to be a withdrawal of his proposal. But that was
enough; and perhaps she even experienced some slight
sense of relief. As for his rebuking of her, she heeded
not that.</p>

<p>"As you will, sir, as you will," she said, listlessly, and
she rose from her chair.</p>

<p>And he rose too. Perhaps he was truly offended; perhaps
he only appeared to be; but at all events he bade her
farewell in a cold and formal manner, and as if it were he
who had brought this interview to an end, and that for
good.</p>

<p>"What said he, wench, what said he?" her grandmother
asked (who had been pretending all the time to be gathering
peas, and now came forward). "Nay, I caught but
little&mdash;a word here or there&mdash;and yet methinks 'tis a
brave way of wooing they have nowadays that would question
a maid about her marriage-portion! Heaven's mercy,
did ever any hear the like? 'Twas not so when I was
young&mdash;nay, a maid would have bade him go hang that
brought her such a tale. Oh, the good parson! his
thoughts be not all bent on heaven, I warrant me! Ay,
and what said he? And what saidst thou, wench? Truly
you be in no fit state to answer him; were you well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>enough, and in your usual spirits, the good man would
have his answer&mdash;ay, as sharp as need be. But I will
say no more; Master Quiney hath a vengeful spirit, and
perchance he hath set me too much against the good man;
but as for thyself, lass, there be little cause for talking further
of thy offences, if 'tis thy marriage-portion the parson
be after now!"</p>

<p>"Good grandmother, give me your arm," Judith said,
in a strange way. "My head is so strange and giddy. I
know not what I have said to him&mdash;I scarce can recollect
it&mdash;if I have offended, bid him forgive me&mdash;but&mdash;but I
would have him remain away."</p>

<p>"As I am a living woman," said the old dame (forgetting
her resolve to speak smooth words), "he shall not
come within the door, nor yet within that gate while you
bide with me and would have him kept without! What
then? More talk of chastenings? Marry now Thomas
Quiney shall hear of this&mdash;that shall he&mdash;by my life he
shall!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, good grandmother, pray you blame no one,"
the girl said, and she was trembling somewhat. "'Tis I
that have done all the harm&mdash;to every one. But I know
not what I said&mdash;I&mdash;I would fain lie down, grandmother,
if you will give me your arm so far&mdash;'tis so strangely cold&mdash;I
understand it not&mdash;and I forget what wast he said to me&mdash;but
I trust I offended him not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, but what is it, then, my deary?" the old woman
said, taking both the girl's hands in hers. "What is it
that you should fret about? Nay, fret not, fret not, good
wench; the parson be well away, and there let him bide.
And would you lie down?&mdash;well, come, then; but sure
you shake as if 'twere winter. Come, lass! nay, fret not,
we will keep the parson away, I warrant, if 'tis that vexes
thee!"</p>

<p>"No, grandmother, 'tis not so," the girl said, in a low
voice. "'Twas down by the river, as I think&mdash;'twas chilly
there&mdash;I have felt it ever since, from time to time&mdash;but
'twill pass away when I am laid down and become warm
again."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant it be no worse," the old dame said to
herself, as she shrewdly regarded the girl; but of course
her outward talk, as she took her within-doors, was ostensibly
cheerful. "Come thy ways, then, sweeting, and we
shall soon make thee warm enough. Ay, ay, and Prudence
be coming over this afternoon, as I hear; and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>doubt Thomas Quiney too; and thou must get thyself
dressed prettily, and have supper with us all, though 'tis
no treat to offer to a man of his own wine. Nay, I warrant
me he will think naught of that so thou be there with
a pleasant face for him; he will want nor wine nor aught
else if he have but that, and a friendly word from thee, as
I reckon; ay, and thou shalt put on the lace cuffs now, to do
him fair service for his gift to thee&mdash;that shalt thou, and
why not? I swear to thee, my brave lass, they be fit for a
queen!"</p>

<p>And she would comfort her and help her (just as if this
granddaughter of hers, that always was so bright and gay
and radiant, so self-willed and self-reliant, with nothing
but laughter for the sad eyes of the stricken youths, was
now but a weak and frightened child, that had to be
guarded and coaxed and caressed), and would talk as if all
her thinking was of that visit in the afternoon; but the
only answer was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you send for Prudence, grandmother? Oh, grandmother,
my head aches so! I scarce know what I said."</p>

<p>Swiftly and secretly the old dame sent across to the
town; and not to Prudence only, but also (for she was
grown anxious) to Mistress Hall, to say that if her husband
were like to return soon to Stratford he might come
over and see Judith, who was far from well. As for Prudence,
a word was sufficient to bring her; she was there
straightway.</p>

<p>She found Judith very much as she had left her, but
somewhat more restless and feverish perhaps, and then
again hopelessly weak and languid, and always with those
racking pains in the head. She said it was nothing&mdash;it
would soon pass away; it was but a chill she had caught
in sitting on the river-bank; would not Prudence now go
back to her duties and her affairs in the house?</p>

<p>"Judith," said her friend, leaning over her and speaking
low, "I have that to tell thee will comfort thee, methinks."</p>

<p>"Nay, I cannot listen to it now," was the answer&mdash;and
it was a moan almost. "Dear mouse, do not trouble
about me&mdash;but my head is so bad that I&mdash;that I care not
now. And the parson is gone away, thinking that I have
wronged him also&mdash;'tis ever the same now&mdash;oh, sweetheart,
my head, my head!"</p>

<p>"But listen, Judith," the other pleaded. "Nay, but
you must know what your friends are ready to do for
you&mdash;this surely will make thee well, sweetheart. Think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>of it now; do you know that Quiney is gone to see your
father?"</p>

<p>"To my father!" she repeated, and she tried to raise
her head somewhat, so that her eyes might read her
friend's face.</p>

<p>"I am almost sure of it, dear heart," Prudence said,
taking her hot hand in hers. "Nay, he would have
naught said of it. None of his family know whither he is
gone, and I but guess. But this is the manner of it, dear
Judith&mdash;that he and I were talking, and sorely vexed he
was that your father should be told a wrong story concerning
you&mdash;ay, and sorry to see you so shaken, Judith, and
distressed; and said he, 'What if I were to get a message
to her from her father&mdash;that he was in no such mood of
anger&mdash;and had not heard the story aright&mdash;and that he was
well disposed to her, and grieved to hear she had taken it
so much to heart&mdash;would not that comfort her?' he said.
And I answered that assuredly it would, and even more
perchance than he thought of; and I gathered from him
that he would write to some one in London to go and see
your father, and pray him to send you assurance of that
kind. But now&mdash;nay, I am certain of it, dear Judith&mdash;I
am certain that he himself is gone all the way to London
to bring thee back that comfort; and will not that cheer
thee now, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"He is doing all that for me?" the girl said, in a low
voice, and absently.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you must be well and cheerful, good mouse,
to give him greeting when he comes back," said Prudence,
striving to raise her spirits somewhat. "Have I not read
to thee many a time how great kings were wont to reward
the messengers that brought them good news?&mdash;a gold
chain round their neck, or lands perchance. And will you
have no word of welcome for him? Will you not meet
him with a glad face? Why, think of it now&mdash;a journey
to London&mdash;and the perils and troubles by the way&mdash;and
all done to please thee. Nay, he would say naught of it to
any one&mdash;lest they might wonder at his doing so much for
thee, belike&mdash;but when he comes back 'twere a sorry thing
that you should not give him a good and gracious welcome."</p>

<p>Judith lay silent and thinking for a while, and then she
said&mdash;but as if the mere effort to speak were too much for
her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whatever happens, dear Prudence&mdash;nay, in truth I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>think I am very ill&mdash;tell him this&mdash;that he did me wrong&mdash;he
thought I had gone to meet the parson that Sunday
morning in the church-yard&mdash;'twas not so&mdash;tell him it was
not so&mdash;'twas but a chance, dear heart&mdash;I could not help
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Judith, Judith," her friend said, "these be things for
thine own telling. Nay, you shall say all that to himself,
and you must speak him fair; ay, and give him good welcome
and thanks that hath done so much for thee."</p>

<p>Judith put her head down on the pillow again, languidly;
but presently Prudence heard her laugh to herself, in a
strange way.</p>

<p>"Last night," she said&mdash;"'twas so wonderful, dear Prue&mdash;I
thought I was going about in a strange country, looking
for my little brother Hamnet, and I knew not whether
he would have any remembrance of me. Should I have
to tell him my name? I kept asking myself. And 'Judith,
Judith,' I said to him, when I found him; but he scarce
knew; I thought he had forgotten me, 'tis so long ago
now; 'Judith, Judith,' I said; and he looked up, and he
was so strangely like little Willie Hart that I wondered
whether it was Hamnet or no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Prudence was alarmed by these wanderings, and
did her best to hush them. And then, when at length the
girl lay silent and still, Prudence stole down-stairs again
and bade the grandmother go to Judith's room, for that
she must at once hurry over to Stratford to speak with
Susan Hall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h3>ARRIVALS.</h3>

<p>Some few mornings after that two travellers were standing
in the spacious archway of the inn at Shipston, chatting
to each other, and occasionally glancing toward the
stable-yard, as if they were expecting their horses to be
brought round.</p>

<p>"The wench will thank thee for this service done her,"
the elder of the two said; and he regarded the younger
man in a shrewd and not unkindly way.</p>

<p>"Nay, I am none well pleased with the issue of it at
all," the young man said, moodily.</p>

<p>"What, then?" his companion said. "Can nothing be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>done and finished but with the breaking of heads? Must
that ever crown the work? Mercy on us!&mdash;how many
would you have slaughtered? now 'tis the parson that
must be thrown into the Avon; again it is Gentleman
Jack you would have us seek out for you; and then it is
his friend, whose very name we know not, that you would
pursue through the dens and stews of London town. A
hopeful task, truly, for a Stratford youth! What know
you of London, man? And to pursue one whose very
name you have not&mdash;and all for the further breaking of
heads, that never did any good anywhere in the world."</p>

<p>"Your are right, sir," the younger man said, with some
bitterness. "I can brag and bluster as well as any. But
I see not that much comes of it. 'Tis easy to break the
heads of scoundrels&mdash;in talk. Their bones are none the
worse."</p>

<p>"And better so," the other said, gravely. "I will have
no blood shed. What, man, are you still fretting that I
would not leave you behind in London?"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, altogether I like not the issue of it," he said,
but respectfully enough. "I shall be told, I doubt not,
that I might have minded my own business. They will
blame me for bringing you all this way and hindering
your affairs."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless us," said the other, laughing, "may not
a man come to see his own daughter without asking leave
of the neighbors?"</p>

<p>"'Tis as like as not that she herself will be the first to
chide me," the younger man answered. "A message to her
was all I asked of you, sir. I dreamt not of hindering
your affairs so."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," said Judith's father, good-naturedly. "I
can make the occasion serve me well. Trouble not about
that, friend Quiney. If we can cheer up the wench, and
put her mind at rest&mdash;that will be a sufficient end of the
journey; and we will have no broken heads withal, so
please you. And if she herself should have put aside
these idle fears, and become her usual self again, why,
then, there is no harm done either. I mind me that some
of them wondered that I should ride down to see my little
Hamnet when he lay sick, for 'twas no serious illness that
time, as it turned out; but what does that make for now?
Now, I tell you, I am right glad I went to see the little
lad; it cheered him to be made so much of, and such
small services or kindnesses are pleasant things for ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>to think of, when those who are dearest to us are
no longer with us. So cease your fretting, friend Quiney,
for the hindering of my affairs I take it that I am answerable
to myself, and not to the good gossips of Stratford
town. And if 'tis merely to say a kind word to the lass&mdash;if
that is all that needs be done&mdash;well, there are many
things that are of different value to different people; and
the wench and I understand each other shrewdly well."</p>

<p>The horses were now brought round; but ere they
mounted, Judith's father said, again regarding the youth
in that observant way,</p>

<p>"Nay, I see how it is with you, good lad&mdash;you are
anxious as to how Judith may take this service you have
done her. Is't not so?"</p>

<p>"Perchance she may be angry that I called you away,
sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Have no fear. 'Twas none of thy doing; 'twas but a
whim of mine own. Nay, there be other and many reasons
for my coming&mdash;that need not be explained to her.
What, must I make apology to my own daughter? She is
not the guardian of Stratford town. I am no rogue; she
is no constable. May not I enter? Nay, nay, have no
fear, friend Quiney; when that she comes to understand
the heavy errand you undertook for her, she will give you
her thanks, or I know nothing of her. Her thanks?&mdash;marry,
yes!"</p>

<p>He looked at the young man again.</p>

<p>"But let there be no broken heads, good friend, I
charge you," said he, as he put his foot in the stirrup.
"If the parson have been over-zealous we will set all matters
straight, without hurt or harm to any son of Adam."</p>

<p>And now as they rode on together, the younger man's
face seemed more confident and satisfied, and he was
silent for the most part. Of course he would himself be
the bearer of the news; it was but natural that he should
claim as much. And as Judith's father intended to go
first to New Place, Quiney intimated to him that he would
rather not ride through the town; in fact, he wanted to
get straightway (and unobserved, if possible) to Shottery,
to see how matters were there.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the little hamlet, Willie Hart was in
the garden, and instantly came down to the gate to meet
him. He asked no questions of the boy, but begged of
him to hold the bridle of his horse for a few minutes; then
he went into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p><p>Just within the threshold he met Judith's sister.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, quickly, and even joyously, "I have
brought good news. Where is Judith? May I see her?
I want to tell her that her father is come, and will be here
to see her presently&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then something in the scared face that was regarding
him struck him with a sudden terror.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said, with his own face become about
as pale as hers.</p>

<p>"Judith is very ill," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, "and that she was when I
left. But now that her father is come, 'twill be all different&mdash;'twill
be all set right now. And you will tell her,
then, if I may not? Nay, but may not I see her for a moment&mdash;but
for a moment&mdash;to say how her father is come
all the way to see her&mdash;ay, and hath a store of trinkets for
her&mdash;and is come to comfort her into the assurance that
all will go well? Why, will not such a message cheer
her?"</p>

<p>"Good Master Quiney," Susan said, with tears welling
into her eyes, "if you were to see her she would not know
you&mdash;she knows no one&mdash;she knows not that she is ill&mdash;but
speaks of herself as some other&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But her father!" he exclaimed, in dismay, "will she
not know him? Will she not understand? Nay, surely
'tis not yet too late!"</p>

<p>But here Doctor Hall appeared; and when he was told
that Judith's father was come to the town, and would
shortly be at the cottage, he merely said that perhaps his
presence might soothe her somewhat, or even lead her <span class="err" title="original: delirous">delirious</span>
wanderings into a gentler channel, but that she
would almost certainly be unable to recognize him. Nor
was the fever yet at its height, he said, and they could do
but little for her. They could but wait and hope. As for
Quiney, he did not ask to be admitted to the room. He
seemed stunned. He sat down in the kitchen, heeding no
one, and vaguely wondering whether any lengthening of
the stages of the journey would have brought them better
in time. Nay, had he not wasted precious hours in London
in vainly seeking to find himself face to face with Jack
Orridge!</p>

<p>Prudence chanced to come down-stairs. As he entered
the kitchen he forgot to give her any greeting; he only
said, quickly,</p>

<p>"Think you she will not understand that her father is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>come to see her? Surely she must understand so much,
Prudence! You will tell her, will you not? and ask her
if she sees him standing before her?"</p>

<p>"I know not&mdash;I am afraid," said Prudence, anxiously.
"Perchance it may frighten her the more; forever she
says that she sees him, and always with an angry face
toward her; and she is for hiding herself away from him&mdash;and
even talking of the river! Good lack, 'tis pitiful
that she should be so struck down&mdash;and almost at death's
door&mdash;and all we can do of so little avail."</p>

<p>"Prudence," said he, starting to his feet, "there is her
father just come; I hear him; now take him to her&mdash;and
you will see&mdash;you will see. I may not go&mdash;a strange face
might frighten her&mdash;but I know she will recognize him&mdash;and
understand&mdash;and he will tell her to have no longer any
fear of him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Prudence hurried away to meet Judith's father, who was
in the doorway, getting such information as was possible,
from the doctor. And then they all of them (all but
Quiney) stole gently up-stairs; and they stood at the door
in absolute silence, while Judith's father went forward to
the bed&mdash;so quietly that the girl did not seem to notice
his approach.</p>

<p>The grandmother was there, sitting by the bedside and
speaking to her in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Hush thee now, sweeting, hush thee now," she was
saying, and she patted her hand. "Nay, I know 'twas ill
done; 'tis quite right what thou sayest; they treated her
not well; and the poor wench anxious to please them all.
But have no fear for her&mdash;nay, trouble not thy head with
thoughts of her&mdash;she be safe at home again, I trust.
Hush thee, now, sweeting; 'twill go well with her, I
doubt not; I swear to thee her father be no longer angry
with the wench; 'twill all go well with her, and well.
Have no fear."</p>

<p>The girl looked at her steadily, and yet with a strange
light in her eyes, as if she saw distant things before her,
or was seeking to recall them.</p>

<p>"There was Susan, too," she said, in a low voice, "that
sang so sweet&mdash;oh, in the church it was so sweet to hear
her; but when it was '<i>The rose is from my garden gone</i>,' she
would not sing that, though that was ever in her sister's
mind after she went away down to the river-side. I cannot
think why they would not sing it to her; perchance the
parson thought 'twas wicked&mdash;I know not now. And when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>she herself would try it with the lute, nothing would come
right&mdash;all went wrong with her&mdash;all went wrong; and her
father came angry and terrible to seek her&mdash;and 'twas the
parson that would drag her forth&mdash;the bushes were not
thick enough&mdash;good grandam, why should the bushes in
the garden be so thin that the terrible eyes peered through
them, and she tried to hide and could not?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I tell thee, sweetheart," said the grandmother,
whispering to her, "that the poor wench you speak of
went home; and all were well content with her, and her
father was right pleased; indeed, indeed, 'twas so."</p>

<p>"Poor Judith, poor Judith!" the girl murmured to herself;
and then she laughed slightly. "She was ever the
stupid one; naught would go right with her; ay, and evil-tempered
she was, too, for Quiney would ride all the way
to London for her, and she thanked him with never a word
or a look&mdash;never a word or a look, and he going all the
way to please her. Poor wench, all went wrong with her
somehow; but they might have let her go; she was so
anxious to hide; and then to drag her forth&mdash;from under
the bushes&mdash;grandam, it was cruelly done of them, was
it not?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, but hush thee now, dearie," her grandmother
said, as she put a cool cloth on the burning forehead. "'Tis
quite well now with the poor wench you speak of."</p>

<p>Her father drew nearer, and took her hand quietly.</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, "poor lass, I am come to see you."</p>

<p>For an instant there was a startled look of fear in her
eyes; but that passed, and she regarded him at first with
a kind of smiling wonder, and thereafter with a contented
satisfaction, as though his presence was familiar. Nay, she
turned her attention altogether toward him now, and addressed
him&mdash;not in any heart-broken way, but cheerfully,
and as if he had been listening to her all along. It was
clear that she did not in the least know who he was.</p>

<p>"There now, lass," said he, "knowest thou that Quiney
and I have ridden all the way from London to see thee?
and thou must lie still and rest, and get well again, ere we
can carry thee out into the garden."</p>

<p>She was looking at him with those strangely brilliant
eyes.</p>

<p>"But not into the garden," she said, in a vacant kind of
way. "That is all gone away now&mdash;gone away. 'Twas
long ago&mdash;when poor Judith used to go into the garden&mdash;and
right fair and beautiful it was&mdash;ay, and her father would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>praise her hair and the color of it&mdash;until he grew angry,
and drove her away far from him then&mdash;and then&mdash;she
wandered down to the river&mdash;and always Susan's song was
in her mind&mdash;or the other one, that was near as sad as that,
about the western wind, was it not? How went it now?&mdash;</p>

<p>And here she turned away from them and fell a-crying,
and hid from them, as it were, covering her face with both
her hands.</p>

<p>"Grandmother, grandmother," they could hear her say
through her sobbing, "there was but the one rose in my
garden, and that is gone now&mdash;they have robbed me of
that&mdash;and what cared I for aught else? And Quiney is
gone too, without a word or a look&mdash;without a word or a
look&mdash;and ere he be come back&mdash;well, I shall be away by
then&mdash;he will have no need to quarrel with me and think
ill of me that I chanced to meet the parson. 'Tis all over
now, grandmother, and done with, and you will let me bide
with you for just a little while longer&mdash;a little while, grandmother;
'tis no great matter for so little a while, though
I cannot help you as I would&mdash;but Cicely is a good lass&mdash;and
'twill be for a little while&mdash;for last night again I found
Hamnet&mdash;ay, ay, he hath all things in readiness now&mdash;all
in readiness&mdash;&mdash;" And then she uttered a slight cry, or
moan rather. "Grandmother, grandmother, why do you
not keep the parson away from me? You said that you
would!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, child," the grandmother said, bending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>over her and speaking softly and closely. "You are over-concerned
about the poor lass that was treated so ill. Take
heart now; I tell thee all is going well with her; her father
hath taken her home again, and she is as happy as
the day is long. Nay, I swear to thee, good wench, if thou
lie still and restful, I will take thee to see her some of these
days. Hush thee now, dearie; 'tis going right well with
the lass now."</p>

<p>The doctor touched the arm of Judith's father, and they
both withdrew.</p>

<p>"She knew you not," said he; "and the fewer people
around her the better&mdash;they set her fancies wandering."</p>

<p>They went down-stairs to where Quiney was awaiting
them, and the sombre look on their faces told its tale.</p>

<p>"She is in danger!" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>The doctor was busy with his own thoughts, but he
glanced at the young man and saw the burning anxiety of
his eyes.</p>

<p>"The fever must run its course," said he, "and Judith
hath had a brave constitution these many years that I fear
not will make a good fight. 'Twas a sore pity that she was
so distressed and stricken down in spirits, as I hear, ere
the fever seized her."</p>

<p>Quiney turned to the window.</p>

<p>"Too late&mdash;too late!" said he. "And yet I spared not
the nag."</p>

<p>"You have done all that man could do," her father said,
going to him. "Nay, had I myself guessed that she was
in such peril&mdash;but 'tis past recall now."</p>

<p>And then he took the young man by the hand, and
grasped it firmly.</p>

<p>"Good lad," said he, "this that you did for us was a
right noble act of kindness, and I trust in Heaven's mercy
that Judith herself may live to thank you. As for me, my
thanks to you are all too poor and worthless; and I must
be content to remain your debtor&mdash;and your friend."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>AN AWAKENING.</h3>

<p>It was going ill with her. Late one night, Quiney,
who had kept hovering about the house, never able to sit
patiently and watch the anxious coming and going within-doors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>and never able to tear himself away but for a few
hundred yards, wandered out into the clear starlit darkness.
His heart was full. They had told him the crisis
was near at hand. And almost it seemed to him that it
was already over. Judith was going away from them.
And those stars overhead&mdash;he knew but little of their
names; he understood but little of the vast immensities
and deeps that lay between them; they were to him but
as grains of light in a darkened floor: and far above that
floor rose the wonderful shining city that he had heard of
in the Book of Revelation. And already, so wild and unstrung
were his fancies, he could see the four square walls
of jasper, and the gates of pearl, and the wide white steps
leading up to these; and who was that who went all alone&mdash;giving
no backward thought to any she was leaving behind&mdash;up
those shining steps, with a strange light on her
forehead and on her trembling hands? He saw her slowly
kneel at the gate, her head meekly bowed, her hands
clasped. And when they opened it, and when she rose, and
made to enter, he could have cried aloud to her for one
backward look, one backward thought, toward Stratford
town and the friends of her childhood and her youth. Alas!
there was no such thing. There was wonder on her face, as
she turned to this side and to that, and she went hesitatingly;
and when they took her hands to lead her forward, she regarded
them&mdash;this side and that&mdash;pleased and wondering
and silent; but there was never a thought of Stratford town.
Could that be Judith that was going away from them so&mdash;she
that all of them had known so dearly? And to leave her
own friends without one word of farewell! Those others
there&mdash;she went with them smiling and wondering, and
looking in silence from one to the other&mdash;but she knew
them not. Her friends were here&mdash;here&mdash;with breaking
hearts because she had gone away and forgotten them,
and vanished within those far-shining gates.</p>

<p>And then some sudden and sullen thought of the future
would overtake him. The injunctions laid on him by
Judith's father could not be expected to last forever. And
if this were to be so&mdash;if the love and desire of his youth
were to be stolen away from him&mdash;if her bright young life,
that was so beautiful a thing to all who knew her, was to
be extinguished, and leave instead but a blankness and an
aching memory through the long years&mdash;then there might
arrive a time for a settlement. The parson was still coming
about the house, for the women-folk were comforted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>by his presence; but Judith's father regarded him darkly,
and had scarce ever a word for him. As for Quiney, he
moved away, or left the house, when the good man came
near&mdash;it was safer so. But in the future? When one was
freer to act? For those injunctions could not be expected
to last forever; and what greater joy could then be secured
than the one fierce stroke of justice and revenge?
He did not reason out the matter much: it was a kind of
flame in his heart whenever he thought of it.</p>

<p>And in truth that catastrophe was nearly occurring now.
He had been wandering vaguely along the highways, appealing
to the calmness of the night, as it were, and the
serenity of the starlit heavens, for some quieting of his terrible
fears; and then in his restlessness he walked back
toward the cottage, anxious for further news and yet
scarcely daring to enter and ask. He saw the dull red
light in the window, but could hear no sound. And would
not his very footfall on the path disturb her? They all of
them went about the house like ghosts. And were it not
better that he should remain here, so that the stillness
dwelling around the place should not be broken even by
his breathing? So quiet the night was, and so soundless,
he could have imagined that the wings of the angel of
mercy were brooding over the little cottage, hushing it, as
it were, and bringing rest and sleep to the sore-bewildered
brain. He would not go near. These were the
precious hours. And if peace had at last stolen into the
sick-chamber, and closed the troubled eyelids, were it not
better to remain away, lest even a whisper should break
the charm?</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw the door of the cottage open, and in
the dull light a dark figure appeared. He heard footsteps
on the garden-path. At first his heart felt like a stone,
and he could not move, for he thought it was some one
coming to seek him with evil views; but presently, in the
clear starlight, he knew who this was that was now approaching
him. He lost his senses. All the black night
went red.</p>

<p>"So, good parson," said he (but he clinched his fists
together so that he should not give way), "art thou satisfied
with thy handiwork?"</p>

<p>There was more of menace in the tone than in the taunt;
at all events, with some such phrase as "Out of the way,
tavern-brawler!" the parson raised his stick, as if to defend
himself, And then the next instant, he was gripped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>firm, as in a vise; the stick was twisted from his grasp and
whirled away far into the dark; and forthwith, for it all
happened in a moment, five fingers had him by the back
of the neck.</p>

<p>There was one second of indecision&mdash;what it meant to
this young athlete, who had his eyes afire and his mind
afire with thoughts of the ill that had been done to the one
he loved the dearest, can well be imagined. But he flung
his enemy from him, forward, into the night.</p>

<p>"Take thy dog's life and welcome&mdash;coward and woman-striker!"</p>

<p>He waited; there was no answer. And then, all shaking
from the terrible pressure he had put on himself, and
still hungering and athirst to go back and settle the matter
then and there, he turned and walked along the road,
avoiding the cottage, and still with his heart aflame, and
wondering whether he had done well to let the hour of
vengeance go.</p>

<p>But that did not last long. What cared he for this man
that any thought of him should occupy him at such
a moment? All his anxieties were elsewhere&mdash;in that
hushed, small chamber, where the lamp of life was flickering
low, and all awaiting, with fear and trembling, what
the dawn might bring. And if she were to slip away so&mdash;escaping
from them, as it were&mdash;without a word of recognition?
It seemed so hard that the solitary figure going up
those far, wide steps should have no thought for them she
had left behind. As he saw her there, content was on her
face, and a mild radiance and wonder; and her new companions
were pleasant to her. She would go away with
them&mdash;she was content to be with them&mdash;she would disappear
among them, and leave no sign. And Sunday
morning after Sunday morning he would look in vain for
her coming through the church-yard, under the trees;
and there would be a vacant place in the pew; no matter
who might be there, one face would be wanting; and in
the afternoon the wide meadows would be empty. Look
where he might&mdash;from the foot-bridge over the river, from
Bardon Hill, from the Wier Brake&mdash;there would be no
more chance of his descrying Judith walking with Prudence&mdash;the
two figures that he could make out at any distance
almost. And what a radiance there used to be on her
face&mdash;not that mild wonder that he saw as she passed away
with her companions within the shining gates, but a happy,
audacious radiance, so that he could see she was laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>long ere he came near her. That was Judith&mdash;that was
the Judith he had known&mdash;laughing, radiant&mdash;in summer
meadows, as it seemed to him&mdash;careless of the young men,
though her eyes would regard them&mdash;and always with her
chief secrets and mystifications for her friend Prudence.
That was Judith&mdash;not this poor, worn sufferer, wandering
through darkened ways, the frail lamp of her life going
down and down, so that they dared not speak in the room.
And that message that she had left for him with Prudence&mdash;was
it a kind of farewell? They were about the last
words she had spoken ere her speech lost all coherence
and meaning&mdash;a farewell before she entered into that dark
and unknown realm. And there was a touch of reproach
in them too&mdash;"Tell him he did me wrong to think I had
gone to meet the parson in the church-yard: 'twas but a
chance." The Judith of those former days was far too
proud to make any such explanation; but this poor
stricken creature seemed anxious to appease every one
and make friends. And was he to have no chance of begging
her forgiveness for doing her that wrong, and of telling
how little she need regard it, and how that she might
dismiss the parson from her mind altogether, as he had
done? The ride to London&mdash;she knew nothing of that;
she knew nothing of her father having come all the way
to see her. Why, as they came riding along by Uxbridge
and Wycombe, and Woodstock and Enstone, many a time
he looked forward to telling Judith of what he had done;
and he hoped that she would go round to the stable and
have a word for the Galloway nag and pet the good beast's
neck. But all that was over now, and only this terrible
darkness and the silence of the roads and the trees; and
always the dull, steady, ominous light in the small window.
And still more terrible, that vision overhead&mdash;the
far and mystic city, and Judith entering with those new
and strange companions, regarding this one and that, and
ever with a smile on her face and a mild wonder in her
eyes; they leading her away by the hand, and she timid,
and looking from one to the other, but pleased to go with
them into the strange country. And as for her old friends,
no backward look or backward thought for them; for
them only the sad and empty town, the voiceless meadows,
the vacant space in the pew, to which many an eye would be
turned as week by week came round. And there would be
a grave somewhere that Prudence would not leave untended.</p>

<p>But with the first gray light of the dawn there came a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>sudden trembling joy, that was so easily and eagerly translated
into a wild, audacious hope. Judith had fallen into
a sound sleep&mdash;a sleep hushed and profound, and no longer
tortured with moanings and dull low cries as if for pity; a
slumber profound and beneficent, with calmer breathing
and a calmer pulse. If only on the awakening she might
show that the crisis was over, and she started on the road&mdash;however
long and tedious that might be&mdash;toward the
winning back of life and health!</p>

<p>It was Prudence who brought him the news. She looked
like a ghost in the wan light, as she opened the door and
came forth. She knew he would not be far away; indeed,
his eyes were more accustomed to this strange light than
hers, and ere she had time to look about and search for
him he was there. And when she told him this news, he
could not speak for a little while, for his mind rushed forward
blindly and wildly to a happy consummation; he
would have no misgivings; this welcome sleep was a sure
sign Judith was won back to them; not yet was she to go
away all alone up those wide, sad steps.</p>

<p>"And you, Prudence," said he, or rather he whispered
it eagerly, that no sound should disturb the profound quiet
of the house, "now you must go and lie down; you are
worn out; why, you are all trembling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The morning air is a little cold," said she; but it was
not that that caused her trembling.</p>

<p>"You must go and lie down, and get some sleep too,"
said he (but glancing up at the window, as if his thoughts
were there). "What a patient watcher you have been!
And now when there is this chance&mdash;do, dear Prudence,
go within and lie down for a while&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, how could I?" she said; and unknown to herself
she was wringing her hands&mdash;not from grief, but from
mere excitement and nervousness. "But for this sleep,
now, the doctor was fearing the worst. I know it, though
he would not say it. And she is so weak! Even if this
sleep calm her brain, or if she come out of it in her right
mind&mdash;one never knows, she is so worn away&mdash;she might
waken only to slip away from us."</p>

<p>But he would not hear of that. No, no; this happy
slumber was but the beginning of her recovery. Now
that she was on the turn, Judith's brave constitution would
fight through the rest. He knew it; he was sure of it;
had there ever been a healthier, a happier wench&mdash;or one
with such gallant spirits and cheerfulness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>"You have not seen her these last two days," Prudence
said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Nay, I fear not now&mdash;I know she will fight through,"
said he, confidently (even with an excess of confidence, so
as to cheer this patient and gentle nurse). "And what a
spite it is that I can do nothing? Did you ask the doctor,
Prudence? Is there nothing that I can fetch him from Harwich?
ay, or from London, for that matter? 'Tis well for
you that can do so much for your friend: what can I do
but hang about the lanes? I would take a message anywhere,
for any of you, if you would but tell me; 'tis all
that I can do. But when she is getting better, that will be
different&mdash;that will be all different then; I shall be able
to get her many things, to please her and amuse her; and&mdash;and&mdash;think
of this, Prudence," said he, his fancies running
away with him in his eagerness, "do you not think,
now, that when she is well enough to be carried into the
garden&mdash;do you not think that Pleydell and I could devise
some kind of couch, to be put on wheels, see you, and
slung on leather bands, so that it would go easily? Why,
I swear it could be made&mdash;and might be in readiness for
her. What think you, Prudence? No one could object
if we prepared it. Ay, and we should get it to go as
smooth as velvet, so that she could be taken along the
lanes or through the meadows."</p>

<p>"I would there were need of it," Prudence said, wistfully.
"You go too fast. Nay, but if she come well out
of this deep sleep, who knows? Pray Heaven there be
need for all that you can do for her."</p>

<p>The chirping of a small bird close by startled them&mdash;it
was the first sound of the coming day. And then she said,
regarding him,</p>

<p>"Would you like to see Judith&mdash;for a moment? 'Twould
not disturb her."</p>

<p>He stepped back, with a sudden look of dismay on his
face.</p>

<p>"What mean you, Prudence?" he said, quickly. "You
do not think that&mdash;that&mdash;there is fear&mdash;that I should look
at her now?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not so; I trust not," she said simply. "But if
you wished, you might slip up the stair; 'twould do no
harm."</p>

<p>He stooped and took off his shoes and threw them aside;
then she led the way into the house, and they went
stealthily up the short wooden stair. The door was open an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>inch or two; Prudence opened it still farther, but did not
go into the room. Nor did he; he remained at the threshold,
for Judith's mother, who was sitting by the bedside,
and who had noticed the slight opening of the door, had
raised her hand quietly, as if in warning. And was this
Judith, then, that the cold morning light, entering by the
small casement, showed him&mdash;worn and wasted, the natural
radiance of her face all fled, and in place of that a dull,
hectic tone that in nowise concealed the ravages the fever
had made? But she slept sound. The bent arm, that she
had raised to her head ere she fell asleep, lay absolutely
still. No, it was not the Judith he had known&mdash;so gay
and radiant and laughing in the summer meadows; but
the wasted form still held a precious life, and he had no
mistrust&mdash;he would not doubt; there was there still what
would win back for him the Judith that he had known&mdash;ay,
if they had to wait all through the winter for the first
silver-white days of spring.</p>

<p>They stole down-stairs again and went to the front door.
All the world was awaking now; the light was clear
around them; the small birds were twittering in the
bushes.</p>

<p>"And will you not go and get some sleep now, Prudence?"
said he. "Surely you have earned it; and now
there is the chance."</p>

<p>"I could not," she said simply. "There will be time for
sleep by-and-by. But now, if you would do us a service,
will you go over to the town, and tell Susan that Judith is
sleeping peacefully, and that she need not hurry back, for
there be plenty of us to watch and wait? And Julius
would like to hear the good news, that I know. Then you
yourself&mdash;do you not need rest? Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heed not for me, dear Prudence," said he quickly, as
if it were not worth while wasting time on that topic.
"But is there naught else I can do for you? Naught that
I can bring for you&mdash;against her getting well again?"</p>

<p>"Nay, 'tis all too soon for that," was Prudence's answer.
"I would the occasion were here, and sure."</p>

<p>Well, he went away over to the town, and told his tale
to those that were astir, leaving a message for those who
were not; and then he passed on to his own house, and
threw himself on his bed. But he could not rest. It was
too far away, while all his thoughts were concentrated
on the small cottage over there. So he wandered back
thither, and again had assurance that Judith was doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>well; and then he went quietly up to the summer-house
and sat down there; and scarcely had he folded his arms
on the little table, and bent forward his head, than he was
in a deep sleep, nature claiming her due at last.</p>

<p>The hours passed; he knew nothing of them. He was
awakened by Judith's father, and he looked around him
strangely, for he saw by the light that it was now afternoon.</p>

<p>"Good lad," said he, "I make no scruple of rousing
you. There is better news. She is awake, and quite calm
and peaceable, and in her right mind&mdash;though sadly weak
and listless, poor wench."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her&mdash;have you spoken with her?" he
said, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Nay, not yet," Judith's father said. "I am doubtful.
She is so faint and weak. I would not disturb her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray you, sir, go and speak with her!" Quiney entreated.
"Nay, I know that will give her more peace of
mind than anything. And if she begin to recall what
happened ere she fell ill&mdash;I pray you, sir, of your
kindness, go and speak with her."</p>

<p>Judith's father went away to the house slowly, and with
his head bent in meditation. He spoke to the doctor for
a few minutes. But when, after some deliberation, he
went up-stairs and into the room, it was his own advice,
his own plan, he was acting on.</p>

<p>He went forward to the bedside and took the chair that
the old grandmother had instantly vacated, and sat down
just as if nothing had occurred.</p>

<p>"Well, lass, how goes it with thee?" he said, with an
air of easy unconcern. "Bravely well, I hear. Thou
must haste thee now, for soon we shall be busy with the
brewing."</p>

<p>She regarded him in a strange way, perhaps wondering
whether this was another vision. And then she said,
faintly,</p>

<p>"Why are you come back to Stratford, father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have many affairs on hand," said he; "and yet
I like not the garden to be so empty. I cannot spare thee
over here much longer. 'Tis better when thou art in the
garden, and little Bess with thee&mdash;nay, I swear to thee
thou disturbest me not&mdash;and so must thou get quickly well
and home again."</p>

<p>He took her hand&mdash;the thin, worn, white hand&mdash;and
patted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>"Why," said he, "I hear they told thee some foolish
story about me. Believe them not, lass. Thou and I are
old friends, despite thy saucy ways, and thy laughing at
the young lads about, and thy lecturing of little Bess Hall&mdash;oh,
thou hast thy faults&mdash;a many of them too&mdash;but heed
no idle stories, good lass, that come between me and thee.
Nay, I will have a sharp word for thee an thou do not as
the doctor bids; and thou must rest thee still and quiet,
and trouble not thy head, for we want thee back to us at
New Place. Why, I tell thee I cannot have the garden
left so empty; wouldst have me with none to talk with
but goodman Matthew? So now farewell for the moment,
good wench; get what sleep thou canst, and take what
the doctor bids thee; why, knowest thou not of the ribbons
and gloves I have brought thee all the way from
London? I warrant me they will please thee!"</p>

<p>He patted her hand again, and rose and left, as if it were
all a matter of course. For a minute or two after the girl
looked dazed and bewildered, as if she were trying to recall
many things; but always she kept looking at the hand
that he had held, and there was a pleased light in her sad
and tired eyes. She lay still and silent&mdash;for so she had
been enjoined.</p>

<p>But by-and-by she said, in a way that was like the ghost
of Judith's voice of old,</p>

<p>"Grandmother&mdash;I can scarce hold up my hand&mdash;will
you help me? What is this that is on my head?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'tis a pretty lace cap that Susan brought thee,"
the grandmother said, "and we would have thee smart
and neat ere thy father came in."</p>

<p>But she had got her hand to her head now, and then
the truth became known to her. She began to cry
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother, grandmother," she said, or sobbed,
"they have cut off my hair, and my father will never look
with favor on me again. 'Twas all he ever praised!"</p>

<p>"Dearie, dearie, thy hair will grow again as fair as ever&mdash;ay,
and who ever had prettier?" the old grandmother
said. "Why, surely; and the roses will come to thy
cheeks, too, that were ever the brightest of any in the
town. Thy father&mdash;heardst thou not what he said a moment
ago&mdash;that he could not bear to be without thee?
Nay, nay, fret not, good lass, there be plenty that will
right gladly wait for the growing of thy hair again&mdash;ay,
ay, there be plenty and to spare that will hold thee in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>high favor and think well of thee&mdash;and thy father most of
all of them&mdash;have no fear!"</p>

<p>And so the grandmother got her soothed and hushed,
and at last she lay still and silent. But she had been
thinking.</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said she, regarding her thin, wasted
hand, "is my face like that?"</p>

<p>"Hush thee, child; thou must not speak more now, or
the doctor will be scolding me."</p>

<p>"But tell me, grandmother," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Why, then," she answered, evasively, "it be none so
plump as it were&mdash;but all that will mend&mdash;ay, ay, good
lass, 'twill mend, surely."</p>

<p>Again she lay silent for a while, but her mind was busy
with its own fears.</p>

<p>"Grandmother," she said, "will you promise me this&mdash;to
keep Quiney away? You will not let him come into
the room, good grandmother, should he ever come over to
the cottage?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and be this thy thanks, then, to him that rode all
the way to London town to bring thy father to thee?"
said the old dame, with some affectation of reproach.
"Were I at thy age I would have a fairer message for him."</p>

<p>"A message, grandmother?" the girl said, turning her
languid eyes to her with some faint eagerness. "Ay, that
I would send him willingly. He went to London for me,
that I know; Prudence said so. But perchance he would
not care to have it, would he, think you?"</p>

<p>The old dame listened, to make sure that the doctor
was not within hearing, for this talking was forbidden;
but she was anxious to have the girl's mind pleased and
at rest, and so she took Judith's hand and whispered to
her.</p>

<p>"A message? Ay, I warrant me the lad would think
more of it than of aught else in the world. Why, sweetheart,
he hath been never away from the house all this
time&mdash;watching to be of service to any one&mdash;night and day
it hath been so&mdash;and that he be not done to death passes
my understanding. Ay, and the riding to London, and
the bringing of thy father, and all&mdash;is't not worth a word
of thanks? Nay, the youth hath won to my favor, I declare
to thee; if none else will speak for him I will; a
right good honest youth, I warrant. But there now,
sweeting, hush thee; I may not speak more to thee, else
the doctor will be for driving me forth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p><p>There was silence for some time; then Judith said,
wistfully,</p>

<p>"What flowers are in the garden now, grandmother?"</p>

<p>The old dame went to the window slowly; it was an excuse
for not having too much talking going on.</p>

<p>"The garden be far past its best now," said she, "but
there be marigolds and Michaelmas daisies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could you get me a bit of rosemary, grandmother?"
the girl asked.</p>

<p>"Rosemary!" she cried in affright, for the mention of
the plant seemed to strike a funeral note. "Foolish
wench, thou knowest I can never get the rosemary bushes
through the spring frosts. Rosemary, truly! What
wantest thou with rosemary?"</p>

<p>"Or a pansy, then?"</p>

<p>"A pansy, doubtless&mdash;ay, ay, that be better now&mdash;we
may find thee a pansy somewhere&mdash;and a plenty of other
things, so thou lie still and get well."</p>

<p>"Nay, I want but the one, grandmother," she said
slowly. "You know I cannot write a message to him, and
yet I would send him some token of thanks for all that he
hath done. And would not that do, grandmother? Could
you but find me a pansy&mdash;if there be one left anywhere&mdash;and
a small leaf or two; and if 'twere put in a folded
paper, and you could give it him from me, and no one
knowing? I would rest the happier, grandmother, for I
would not have him think me ungrateful&mdash;no, no, he must
not think me that. And then, good grandmother, you will
tell him that I wish him not to see me; only&mdash;only, the
little flower will show him that I am not ungrateful;
for I would not have him think me that."</p>

<p>"Rest you still now, then, sweeting," the old dame said.
"I warrant me we will have the message conveyed to
him; but rest you still&mdash;rest you still&mdash;and ere long you
will not be ashamed to show him the roses coming again
into your cheeks."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3>TOWARD THE LIGHT.</h3>

<p>This fresh and clear morning, with a south wind blowing
and a blue sky overhead, made even the back yard of
Quiney's premises look cheerful, though the surroundings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>were mostly empty barrels and boxes. And he was singing,
too, as he went on with his task; sometimes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Play on, minstrl, play on, minstrl,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My lady is mine only girl;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and sometimes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I bought thee petticoats of the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cloth so fine as fine might be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave thee jewels for thy chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all this cost I spent on thee;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">or, again, he would practise his part in the new catch&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Merrily sang the Ely monks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When rowed thereby Canute the King."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet this that he was so busy about seemed to have
nothing to do with his own proper trade. He had chalked
up on the wall a space about the size of an ordinary cottage-window;
at each of the upper corners he had hammered
in a nail, and now he was endeavoring to suspend
from these supports, so that it should stand parallel with
the bottom line, an oblong basket roughly made of wire,
and pretty obviously of his own construction. His dinner
of bread and cheese and ale stood untouched and
unheeded on a bench hard by. Sometimes he whistled,
sometimes he sang, for the morning air was fresh and pleasant,
and the sunlight all about was enlivening.</p>

<p>Presently Judith's father made his appearance, and the
twisting and shaping of the wire hooks instantly ceased.</p>

<p>"She is still going on well?" the lad said, with a rapid
and anxious glance.</p>

<p>"But slowly&mdash;slowly," her father answered. "Nay, we
must not demand too much. If she but hold her own
now, time is on our side, and the doctor is more than ever
hopeful that the fever hath left no serious harm behind it.
When that she is a little stronger, they talk of having her
carried down-stairs&mdash;the room is larger&mdash;and the window
hath a pleasant outlook."</p>

<p>"I heard of that," said Quiney, glancing at the oblong
basket of wire.</p>

<p>"I have brought you other news this morning," Judith's
father said, taking out a letter and handing it to Quiney.
"But I pray you say nothing of it to the wench; her mind
is at rest now; we will let the past go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>"Nay, I can do no harm in that way," said the younger
man, in something of a hurt tone, "for they will not let
me see her."</p>

<p>"No, truly? Why, that is strange, now," her father
said, affecting to be surprised, but having a shrewd guess
that this was some fancy of the girl's own. "But they
would have her kept quiet, I know."</p>

<p>Quiney was now reading the letter. It was from one of
Judith's father's companions in London, and the beginning
of it was devoted to the imparting of certain information
that had apparently been asked from him touching
negotiations for the purchase of a house in Blackfriars.
Quiney rightly judged that this part had naught to do
with him, and scanned it briefly; and as he went on he
came to that which had a closer interest for him.</p>

<p>The writer's style was ornate and cumbrous and confused,
but his story, in plainer terms, was this: The matter
of the purloined play was now all satisfactorily ascertained
and settled, except as regarded Jack Orridge
himself, whom a dire mischance had befallen. It appeared
that, having married a lady possessed of considerable
wealth, his first step was to ransom&mdash;at what cost the
writer knew not&mdash;the play that had been sold to the booksellers,
not by himself but by one Francis Lloyd. It was
said that this Lloyd had received but a trifle for it, and
had, in truth, parted with it in the course of a drunken
frolic; but that "Gentleman Jack," as they called him,
had to disburse a goodly sum ere he could get the manuscript
back into his own hands. That forthwith he had
come to the theatre and delivered up the play, with such
expressions of penitence and shame that they could not
forbear to give him full quittance for his fault. But this
was not all; for, having heard that Francis Lloyd had in
many quarters been making a jest of the matter, and telling
of Orridge's adventures in Warwickshire, and naming
names, the young man had determined to visit him with
personal chastisement, but had been defeated in this by
Lloyd being thrust into prison for debt. That thereafter
Lloyd, being liberated from jail, was sitting in a tavern
with certain companions; and there "Gentleman Jack"
found him, and dealt him a blow on the face with the
back of his hand, with a mind to force the duello upon
him. But that here again Orridge had ill-fortune; for
Lloyd, being in his cups, would fight then and there, and
flung himself on him, without sword or anything, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>thought; but that presently, in the struggle, Orridge uttered
a cry, "I am stabbed," and fell headlong, and they
found him with a dagger-wound in his side, bleeding so that
they thought he would have died ere help came. And
that in truth he had been nigh within death's door, and
was not yet out of the leech's hands; while as for Lloyd,
he had succeeded in making good his escape, and was now
in Flanders, as some reported. This was the gist of the
story, as far as Quiney was interested; thereafter came
chiefly details about the theatre, and the writer concluded
with wishing his correspondent all health and happiness,
and bidding him ever remember "his true loving friend,
Henry Condell."</p>

<p>Quiney handed back the letter.</p>

<p>"I wish the dagger had struck the worser villain of the
two," said he.</p>

<p>"'Tis no concern of ours," Judith's father said. "And
I would have the wench hear never a word more of the
matter. Nay, I have already answered her that 'twas all
well and settled in London, and no harm done; and the
sooner 'tis quite forgotten the better. The young man
hath made what amends he could; I trust he may soon be
well of his wound again. And married, is he? Perchance
his hurt may teach him to be more of a stay-at-home."</p>

<p>Judith's father put the letter in his pocket, and was for
leaving, when Quiney suggested that if he were going to
the cottage he would accompany him, as some business
called him to Bidford. And so they set out together&mdash;the
younger man having first of all made a bundle of the wire
basket and the nails and hooks and what not, so that he
could the more easily carry them.</p>

<p>It was a clear and mild October day; the wide country
very silent; the woods turning to yellow and russet now
and here and there golden leaves fluttering down from the
elms. So quiet and peaceful it all was in the gracious
sunlight; the steady ploughing going on; groups of
people gleaning in the bean-field, but not a sound of any
kind reaching them, save the cawing of some distant rooks.
And when they drew near to Shottery, Quiney had an eye
for the cottage-gardens, to see what flowers or shrubs were
still available; for of course the long wire basket, when it
was hung outside Judith's window, must be filled&mdash;ay, and
filled freshly at frequent intervals. If the gardens or the
fields or the hedge-rows would furnish sufficient store,
there would be no lack of willing hands for the gathering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span></p><p>They went first to the front door (the room that Judith
was to be moved into looked to the back), and here, ere
they had crossed the threshold, they beheld a strange
thing. The old grandmother was standing at the foot of
the wooden stair, with a small looking-glass in her hand;
she had not heard them approach, so it was with some
amazement they saw her deliberately let fall the glass on
to the stone passage, where naturally it was smashed into
a hundred fragments. And forthwith she began to scold
and rate the little Cicely, and that in so loud a voice that her
anger must have been plainly heard in the sick-room above.</p>

<p>"Ah, thou mischief, thou imp, thou idle brat, thou must
needs go break the only looking-glass in the house! A
handy wench, truly; thou can hold nothing with thy silly
fingers, but must break cup and platter and pane, and now
the looking-glass&mdash;'twere well done to box thine ears, thou
mischief!"</p>

<p>And with that she patted the little girl on the shoulder,
and shrewdly winked and smiled and nodded her head;
and then she went up the stair, again and loudly bewailing
her misfortune.</p>

<p>"What a spite be this now!" they could hear her say,
at the door of Judith's room. "The only looking-glass in
the house and just as thou wouldst have it sent for! That
mischievous, idle little wench&mdash;heard you the crash, sweetheart?
Well, well, no matter; I must still have the tiring
of thee&mdash;against any one coming to see thee; ay, and I
would have thee brave and smart, when thou art able to
sit up a bit&mdash;ay, and thy hair will soon be grown again,
sweeting&mdash;and then the trinkets that thy father brought&mdash;and
the lace cuffs that Quiney gave thee&mdash;these and all
thou must wear. Was ever such a spite, now?&mdash;our only
looking-glass to be broken so; but thou shalt not want it,
sweetheart&mdash;nay, nay, thou must rest in my hands&mdash;I will
have thee smart enough; when any would come to see
thee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was all they heard, for now she shut the door; but
both of them guessed readily enough why the good dame
had thrown down and smashed the solitary mirror of the
house.</p>

<p>Then they went within, and heard from Prudence that
Judith was going on well but very slowly, and that her
mind was in perfect calm and content, only that at times
she seemed anxious that her father should return to London,
lest his affairs should be hindered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>"And truly I must go ere long," said he, "but not yet.
Not until she is more fairly on the highway."</p>

<p>They were now in the room that was to be given up to
Judith, because of its larger size.</p>

<p>"Prudence," said Quiney, "if the bed were placed so&mdash;by
the window&mdash;she might be propped up, so that when
she chose she could look abroad. Were not that a simple
thing&mdash;and cheerful for her? And I have arranged a small
matter so that every morning she may find some fresh
blossoms awaiting her&mdash;and yet not disturbing her with
any one wishing to enter the room. Methinks one might
better fix it now, ere she be brought down, so that the
knocking may not harm her."</p>

<p>"I would she were in a fit state to be brought down,"
Prudence said, rather sadly; "for never saw I any one so
weak and helpless."</p>

<p>All the same he went away to see whether the oblong
basket of wire and the fastenings would fit; and although
(being a tall youth) he could easily reach the foot of the
window with his hands, he had to take a chair with him
in order to gain the proper height for the nails. Prudence
from within saw what he was after, and when it was all
fixed up she opened one of the casements to speak to him,
and her face was well pleased.</p>

<p>"Truly, now, that was kindly thought of," said she.
"And shall I tell her of this that you have contrived for
her?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'tis in this way, Prudence," said he, rather shamefacedly,
"she need not know whether 'tis this one or that
that puts a few blossoms in the basket&mdash;'twill do for any
one&mdash;any one that is passing along the road or through
the meadows, and picks up a pretty thing here or there.
'Twill soon be hard to get such things&mdash;save some red
berries or the like&mdash;but when any can stop in passing and
add their mite, 'twill be all the easier, for who that knows
her but hath good-will toward her?"</p>

<p>"And her thanks to whom?" said Prudence, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why, to all of them," said he, evasively. "Nay, I
would not have her even know that I nailed up the little
basket&mdash;perchance she might think I was too officious."</p>

<p>"And can you undo it?" she asked. "Can you take it
down?"</p>

<p>"Surely," he answered, and he lifted the basket off the
hooks to show her.</p>

<p>"For," said she, "if you would bring it round, might we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>not put a few flowers in it, and have them carried up to
Judith, to show her what you have designed for her? In
truth it would please her."</p>

<p>He was not proof against this temptation. He carried
the basket round, and they fell to gathering such blossoms
as the garden afforded&mdash;marigolds, monthly roses, Michaelmas
daisies, and the like, with some scarlet hips from
the neighboring hedges, and some broad green leaves to
serve as a cushion for all of these. But he did not stay to
hear how his present was received. He was on his way to
Bidford, and on foot, for he had kept his promise with the
Galloway nag. So he bade Prudence farewell, and said
he would call in again on his way back in the evening.</p>

<p>The wan, sad face lit up with something like pleasure
when Judith saw this little present brought before her; it
was not the first by many of similar small attentions that
he had paid her&mdash;tokens of a continual thoughtfulness
and affection&mdash;though he was not even permitted to see
her, much less to speak with her. How his business managed
to thrive during this period they could hardly guess,
only that he seemed to find time for everything. Apparently,
he was content with the most hap-hazard meals, and
seemed able to get along with scarcely any sleep at all;
and always he was the most hopeful one in the house,
and would not admit that Judith's recovery seemed
strangely slow, but regarded everything as happening for
the best, and tending toward a certain and happy issue.
One result of his being continually in or about the cottage
was this&mdash;that Master Walter Blaise had not looked near
them since the night on which the fever reached its crisis.
The women-folk surmised that, now there was a fair hope
of Judith's recovery, he perchance imagined his ministrations
to be no longer necessary, and was considerately
keeping out of the way, seeing that he could be of no use.
At all events, they did not discuss the subject much, for
more than one of them had perceived that, whenever the
parson's name was mentioned, Judith's father became reticent
and reserved&mdash;which was about his only way of showing
displeasure&mdash;so that they got into the habit of omitting
all mention of Master Blaise, for the better preserving and
maintaining the serenity of the domestic atmosphere.</p>

<p>And yet Master Blaise came to be talked of&mdash;and to Judith
herself&mdash;this very morning. When Prudence went
into the room, carrying Quiney's flowers, the old grandmother
said she would go down and see how dinner was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>getting forward (she having more mouths to feed than
usual), and Prudence was left in her place, with strict injunctions
to see that Judith took the small portions of food
that had been ordered her at the proper time. Prudence
sat down by the bedside. These two had not had much
confidential chatting of late, for Judith had been forbidden
to talk much, and was, indeed, far too weak and languid
for that, while generally there was some third person
about in attendance. But now they were alone; and Prudence
had a long tale to tell of Quiney's constant watchfulness
and care, and of all the little things he had thought
of and arranged for her, up to the construction of the wire
flower-basket.</p>

<p>"But what he hath done, Judith, to anger Parson Blaise,
I cannot make out," she continued&mdash;"ay, and to anger
him sorely; for yesternight, when I went over to see how
my brother did, I met Master Blaise, and he stayed me
and talked with me for a space. Nay, he spoke too harshly
of Quiney, so that I had to defend him, and say what I
had seen of him&mdash;truly, I was coming near to speaking
with warmth&mdash;and then he went away from that. And
think you what he came to next, Judith?"</p>

<p>The pale, quiet face of the speaker was overspread with
a blush, and she looked timidly at her friend.</p>

<p>"What then, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Perchance I should not tell you," she said, with some
hesitation; and then she said, more frankly, "Nay, why
should there be any concealment between us, Judith?
And he laid no charge of secrecy on me&mdash;in truth, I said
that I would think of it, and might even ask for counsel
and guidance. He would have made me his wife, Judith."</p>

<p>Judith betrayed no atom of surprise, nay, she almost instantly
smiled her approval&mdash;it was a kind of friendly congratulation,
as it were&mdash;and she would have reached out
her hand only that she was so weak.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, dear mouse," said she, as pleasantly
as she could. "There would you be in your proper place;
is't not so? And what said you? what said you, sweetheart?
Ah, they all would welcome you, be sure; and
a parson's wife&mdash;a parson's wife, Prudence&mdash;would not that
be your proper place? would you not be happy so?"</p>

<p>"I know not," the girl said, and she spoke wistfully,
and as if she were regarding distant things. "He had
nearly persuaded me, good heart, for indeed there is such
power and clearness in all he says; and it was almost put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>before me as a duty, and something incumbent on me, for
the pleasing of all of them, and the being useful and serviceable
to so many; and then&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was another timid glance, and she took Judith's
hand; and her eyes were downcast as she made the confession:</p>

<p>"Nay, I will tell thee the truth, sweetheart. Had he
spoken to me earlier&mdash;I&mdash;I might not have said him nay&mdash;so
good a man and earnest withal, and not fearing to
give offence if he can do true service to the Master of us
all. Judith, if it be unmaidenly, blame me not, but at one
time I had thoughts of him; and sometimes, ashamed, I
would not go to your house when he was there in the
afternoon, though Julius wondered, seeing that there was
worship and profitable expounding. But now&mdash;now&mdash;now
'tis different."</p>

<p>"Why, dear mouse, why?" Judith said, with some astonishment;
"you must not flout the good man. 'Tis an
honorable offer."</p>

<p>Prudence was looking back on that past time.</p>

<p>"If he had spoken then," she said, absently, "my heart
would have rejoiced; and well I knew 'twould have been
no harm to you, dear Judith, for who could doubt how
you were inclined&mdash;ay, through all your quarrels and misunderstandings?
And if 'twas you the good parson wished
for in those days&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prudence," her friend said, reproachfully, "you do ill
to go back over a by-gone story. If you had thoughts of
him then, when as yet he had not spoken, why not now,
when he would have you be his wife? 'Tis an honorable
offer, as I say; and you&mdash;were you not meant for a
parson's wife, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>Then Prudence regarded her with her honest eyes.</p>

<p>"I should be afraid, Judith. Perchance I have listened
overmuch to your grandmother's talking and to Quiney's;
they are both of them angered against him. They say he
wrought you ill, and was cruel when he should have been
gentle with you, and was overproud of his office. Nay, I
marked that your father had scarce ever a word for him
when he was coming over to the cottage, but would get
away somehow and leave him. And&mdash;and methinks I should
be afraid, Judith; 'tis no longer as it used to be in former
days; and then, without perfect confidence, how should
one dare to venture on such a step? No, no, Judith, I
should be afraid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>"In truth I cannot advise thee, then, dear heart," her
friend said, looking at her curiously. "For more than
any I know should you marry one that would be gentle
with you and kind. And think you that the parson would
overlord it?"</p>

<p>"I know not&mdash;I know not," she said, in the same absent
way. "But with doubt, with hesitation, without perfect
confidence&mdash;how could one take such a step?"</p>

<p>And then she bethought her.</p>

<p>"Why, now, all this talking over my poor affairs?" she
said, more cheerfully. "A goodly nurse I am proving
myself! 'Tis thy affairs are of greater moment, and thou
must push forward, sweetheart, and get well more rapidly,
else they will say we are careless and foolish, that cannot
bring thee into firmer health."</p>

<p>"But I am well content," said Judith, with a perfectly
placid smile.</p>

<p>"Content! But you must not be content," Prudence
exclaimed. "Would you remain within-doors until your
hair be grown? Vanity is it, then? Ah, for shame&mdash;you that
always professed to be so proud, and careless of what they
thought! Content, truly! Look at so thin a hand&mdash;are
you content to remain so?"</p>

<p>"I am none so ill," Judith said, pleasantly. "The days
pass well enough, and every one is kind."</p>

<p>"But I say you must not be content!" Prudence again
remonstrated. "Did ever any one see such a poor, weak,
white hand as that? Look at the thin, thin veins."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you know not, sweetheart," Judith said, and
she herself looked at those thin blue veins in the white

happiness ever since I came out of the fever and found

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<h3>"WESTERN WIND, WHEN WILL YOU BLOW?"</h3>

<p>There was much laughing among the good folk of Stratford
town&mdash;or rather among those of them allowed to visit
Quiney's back yard&mdash;over the nondescript vehicle that he
and his friend Pleydell were constructing there. But that
was chiefly at the first, when the neighbors would call it a
coffin on wheels or a grown-up cradle; afterward, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>it grew into shape and began to exhibit traces of decoration
(the little canopy at the head, for example, was covered,
over with blue taffeta that made a shelter from the
sun), they moderated their ridicule, and at last declared it
a most ingenious and useful contrivance, and one that
went as easily on its leather bands as any king's coach
that ever was built. And they said they hoped it would
do good service, for they knew it was meant for Judith;
and she had won the favor and good-will of many in that
town, in so far as an unmarried young woman was deemed
worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>But that was an anxious morning when Quiney set forth
with this strange vehicle for the cottage. Little Willie
Hart was there, and Quiney had flung him inside, saying
he would give him a ride as far as Shottery, but thereafter
he did not speak a word to the boy. For this was the
morning on which he was to see Judith for the first time
since the fever had left her, and not only that, but he had
been appointed to carry her down-stairs to the larger room
below. This was by the direct instructions of the doctor.
Judith's father was now in London again, the doctor was
not a very powerful man, the staircase was over-narrow to
let two of the women try it between them; who, therefore,
was there but this young athlete to gather up that
precious charge and bear her gently forth? But when he
thought of that first meeting with Judith he trembled, and
dismay and apprehension filled his heart lest he should
show himself in the smallest way shocked by her appearance.
Careless as she might have been of other things,
she had always put a value on that; she knew she had
good looks, and she liked to look pretty and dainty, and
to wear becoming and pretty things. And again and
again he schooled himself and argued with himself. He
must be prepared to find her changed&mdash;nay, had he not
already had one glimpse of her, as she lay asleep, in the
cold light of the dawn?&mdash;he must be prepared to find the
happy and radiant face no longer that, but all faded and
white and worn, the clear shining eyes no longer laughing,
but sunken and sad, and the beautiful sun-brown hair&mdash;that
was her chiefest pride of all&mdash;no longer clustering
round her neck. Not that he himself cared&mdash;Judith was
for him always and ever Judith, whatever she might be
like, but his terror was lest he should betray, in the smallest
fashion, some pained surprise. He knew how sensitive
she was, and as an invalid she would be even more so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>and what a fine thing it would be if her eyes were suddenly
to fill with tears on witnessing his disappointment!
And so he argued and argued, and strove to think of
Judith as a ghost&mdash;as anything rather than her former
self; and when he reached the cottage, he asked whether
Judith was ready to be brought down, in so matter-of-fact
a way that he seemed perfectly unconcerned.</p>

<p>Well, she was not ready, for her grandmother had the
tiring of her, and the old dame was determined that (if she
had her way) her grandchild should look none too like an
invalid. If the sun-brown curls were gone, at least the
cap that she wore should have pretty blue ribbons where
it met under the chin. And she would have her wear the
lace cuffs, too, that Quiney had brought her from Warwick&mdash;did
not she owe it to him to do service for the gift? And
when all that was done, she made Judith take a little wine-and-water,
to strengthen her for the being carried down-stairs,
and then she sent word that Quiney might come up.</p>

<p>He made his appearance forthwith, a little pale, perhaps,
and hesitating and apprehensive as he crossed the threshold.
And then he came quickly forward, and there was
a sudden wonder of joy and gladness in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Judith," he exclaimed, quite involuntarily, and forgetting
everything, "why, how well you are looking!&mdash;indeed,
indeed you are!&mdash;sweetheart, you are not changed at all!"</p>

<p>For this was Judith; not any of the spectral phantoms
he had been conjuring up, but Judith herself, regarding
him with friendly (if yet timid) eyes, and her face, as he
looked at her in this glad way, was no longer pale, but had
grown rose-red as the face of a bride. Her anxiety and
nervousness had been far greater than she dared to tell any
of them; but now his surprise and delight were surely real,
and then&mdash;for she was very weak, and she had been anxious
and full of fear, and this joy of seeing him&mdash;of seeing a
strange face, that belonged to the former happy time&mdash;was
too much for her. Her lips were tremulous, tears rose
to her eyes, and she would have turned away to hide her
crying&mdash;but that all at once he recalled his scattered senses,
and inwardly cursed himself for a fool, and forthwith addressed
her in the most cheerful and simple way.</p>

<p>"Why, now, what stories they have been telling me, Judith!
I should scarce know you had been ill. You are
thinner&mdash;oh, yes, you are a little thinner; and if you went
to the woods to gather nuts I reckon you would not bring
home a heavy bag; but that will all mend in time. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>honest truth, dear Judith, I am glad to see you looking
none so ill; now I marvel not at your father going away
to see after his affairs&mdash;so sure <span class="err" title="original: be">he</span> must have been."</p>

<p>"I am glad that he went, I was fretting so," she said
(and it was so strange to hear Judith's voice, that always
stirred his heart as if with the vibration of Susan's singing),
and then she added, timidly regarding him&mdash;"and you&mdash;I
have caused you much trouble also."</p>

<p>He laughed; in truth he was so bewildered with the delight
of seeing this real living Judith before him that he
scarce knew what he said.</p>

<p>"Trouble! yes, trouble, indeed, that I could do nothing
for you, and all the others waiting with you and cheering
you. But now, dear Judith, I have something for you&mdash;oh,
you shall see it presently; and you may laugh, but I
warrant me you will find it easy and comfortable when
that you are allowed to go forth into the garden. 'Tis a
kind of couch, as it were, but on wheels&mdash;nay, you may
call it your chariot, Judith, if you would be in state; and
if you may not go farther than the garden at first, why,
then you may lie in it, and have some one read to you;
and there is a small curtain if you would shut them all out
and go to sleep; ay, and when the time comes for you to
go along the lanes, then you may sit up somewhat, for
there are pillows for your head and for your back. As for
the drawing of it, why, little Willie Hart can pull me
when I am in it, and surely he can do the same for you,
that are scarce so heavy as I, as I take it. Oh, I warrant
you, you will soon get used to it; and 'twill be so much
pleasanter for you than being always within-doors&mdash;and
the fresher air&mdash;the fresher air will soon bring back your
color, Judith."</p>

<p>For now that the first flush of embarrassment was gone
he could not but see (though still he talked in that cheerful
strain) how pale and worn was her face; and her
hands, that lay listlessly on the coverlet, with the pretty
lace cuffs going back from the wrists, were spectral hands,
so thin and white were they.</p>

<p>"Master Quiney," said the old dame, coming to the
door, "it be all ready now below, if you can carry the wench
down. And take time&mdash;take time&mdash;there be no hurry."</p>

<p>"You must come and help me, good grandmother," said
he, "to get her well into my arms."</p>

<p>In truth he was trembling with very nervousness as he
set about this task. Should some mischance occur&mdash;some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>stumble! And then he found himself all too strong and
uncouth and clumsy, with her so frail and delicate and
weak. But her grandmother lifted the girl's hand to his
shoulder, or rather to his neck, and bade her hold on so,
as well as she might; and then he got his arms better
round her, and with slow and careful steps made his way
down to the room below. There the bed was near the
window, and when he had gently placed her on it, and
propped up her head and shoulders, so that she was almost
sitting, the first thing that she saw before her was
the slung box of flowers and leaves outside the little casement.
She turned to him and smiled, and looked her
thanks with grateful eyes: he sought for no more than that.</p>

<p>Of course they were all greatly pleased at this new state
of affairs&mdash;it seemed a step on the forward way, a hopeful
thing. Moreover, there was a brighter animation in the
girl's look&mdash;whether that was owing to the excitement of
the change or the pleasure at seeing the face of an old friend.</p>

<p>And as the others seemed busy among themselves, suggesting
small arrangements, and the like, Quiney judged it
was time for him to go; his services were no longer needed.</p>

<p>He went forward to her.</p>

<p>"Judith," said he, "I will bid you good-day now. If
you but knew how glad I am to have seen you&mdash;ay, and to
find you going on so well! I will take away a lighter
heart with me."</p>

<p>She looked up at him hesitating and timid, and then
she gathered courage.</p>

<p>"But why must you go?" said she, with some touch of
color in the pale face.</p>

<p>He glanced at the others.</p>

<p>"Perchance they may not wish me to stay; they may
fear your being tired with talking."</p>

<p>"But if I wish you to stay&mdash;for a little while?" she said,
gently. "If your business call you not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My business!" he said. "My business must shift for
itself on such a day as this; think you 'tis nothing for me
to speak with you again, Judith, after so long a time?"</p>

<p>"And my chariot," she said, brightly&mdash;"may not I see
my chariot?"</p>

<p>"Why, truly!" he cried. "Willie Hart is in charge of
it without. We will bring it along the passage, and you
will see it at the door; and you must not laugh, dear Judith&mdash;'tis
a rude-made thing, I know&mdash;but serviceable&mdash;you
shall have comfort from it, I warrant you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p><p>They wheeled it along the passage, but could not get it
within the apartment; however, through the open door
she could see very easily the meaning and construction of
it. And when she observed with what care and pretty
taste it had been adorned for her, even to the putting ribbons
at the front corners of the little canopy (but this was
not the work of men's fingers; it was Prudence who had
contributed these), she was not in the least inclined to
laugh at the efforts of these good friends to be of use to
her and to gratify her. She beckoned him to come to her.</p>

<p>"'Tis but a patchwork thing to look at," said he, rather
shamefacedly, "but I hope you will find it right comfortable
when you use it. I hope soon to hear of you trying it,
Judith."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," said she.</p>

<p>She took his hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak my thanks to you," she said, in a low
voice, "for not only this but all that you have done for me."</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes, and he was so bewildered,
and his heart so wildly aflame, that he could only touch
her shoulder and say,</p>

<p>"Be still now, Judith. Be still and quiet, and perchance
they may let me remain with you a little space further."</p>

<hr class="l5" />

<p>Well, it was a long and a weary waiting. She seemed, too,
content with her feeble state; there were so many who
were kind to her; and her father sending her messages
from London; and Quiney coming every morning to put
some little things&mdash;branches of evergreens, or the like,
when flowers were no longer to be had&mdash;in the little basket
outside the window. He could reach to that easily;
and when she happened to hear his footsteps coming near,
even when she could not see him, she would tap with her
white fingers on the window-panes&mdash;that was her thanks
to him, and morning greeting.</p>

<p>It was a bitter winter, and ever they were looking forward
to the milder weather, to see when they might risk
taking her out-of-doors, swathed up in her chariot, as she
called it; but the weeks and weeks went by, hard and obdurate,
and at last they found themselves in the new year.
But she could get about the house a little now, in a quiet
way; and so it was that, one morning, she and Quiney
were together standing at the front window, looking abroad
over the wide white landscape. Snow lay everywhere,
thick and silent; the bushes were heavy with it; and far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>beyond those ghostly meadows, though they could not see
it they knew that the Avon was fixed and hard in its winter
sleep, under the hanging banks of the Wier Brake.</p>

<p>"'<i>Western wind, when will you blow?</i>'" she said, and yet
not sadly, for there was a placid look in her eyes: she was
rather complaining, with a touch of the petulance of the
Judith of old.</p>

<p>The arm of her lover was resting lightly on her shoulder&mdash;she
was strong enough to bear that now, and she did not
resent the burden; and she had got her soft sunny-brown
curls again, though still they were rather short; and her
face had got back something of its beautiful curves; and
her eyes, if they were not so cruelly audacious as of old,
were yet clear-shining and gentle, and with abundance of
kind messages for all the world, but with tenderer looks
for only one.</p>

<p>"'<i>Western wind</i>,'" she repeated, with that not over-sad
complaint of injury, "'<i>when will you blow&mdash;when will you
blow?</i>'"</p>

<p>"All in good time, sweetheart, all in good time," said
he; and his hand lay kindly on her shoulder, as if she
were one to whom some measure of gentle tending and
cheering words were somewhat due. "And guess you
now what they mean to do for you when the milder
weather comes? I mean the lads at the school. Why,
then, 'tis a secret league and compact&mdash;I doubt not that
your cousin Willie may have been at the suggesting of it&mdash;but
'twas some of the bigger lads who came to me. And
'tis all arranged now, and all for the sake of you, dear
heart. For when the milder weather comes, and the year
begins to wake again, why, they are all of them to keep a
sharp and eager eye here and there&mdash;in the lanes or in
the woods&mdash;for the early peeping up of the primroses; and
then 'tis to be a grand whole holiday that I am to get for
them, as it appears; and all the school is to go forth to
search the hedge-rows and the woods and the banks&mdash;all
the country-side is to be searched and searched&mdash;and for
what, think you? why, to bring you a spacious basketful of
the very first primroses of the spring! See you, now, what
it is to be the general favorite. Nay, I swear to you, dear
Judith, you are the sweetheart of all of them; and what
a shame it is that I must take you away from them all!"</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
